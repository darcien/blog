## I'm fully recovered (maybe)

Finally! No more sore throat.
Nose some times still feel stuffed.
But that's not enough to stop me from cycling.

## New bike shoes

Maybe sickness is not going to stop me from cycling, but feet pain is.
I just realized the pain in my left feet is from the shoe being too small.
Took me almost 3 years to realize that.
So I bought a wide size 47 Shimano.
One size bigger than my usual.
My friend also told me normally you would pick 1 size up for bike shoes anyway
compared to regular shoes.

## Missing screws

After getting the new cycling shoes, I realized 1 more thing with my old shoes.
The grip under the shoes often slant even though it's already bolted pretty tight.
Turns out there's only 2 screws per shoe.
It should be 3 ü§¶.
What was I thinking when I put these grip on.
And finding replacement plate and screws is harder than buying new grips.
Screw it, I'm buying a new cleat grips.


## Side Order is coming!

I thought the Splatoon 3 DLC is going to be released at the end of 2024.
Turns out no, I misremembered.
It's the end of February instead.
Next month!
How could they add my favorite genre to my already favorite game.
I'm too exicted now. ü¶ëüêôüí®


## Tasty soap

I thought I don't really care about soap smell.
They're all soap right?
I was proven wrong.
Recently I tried using ["For Back" by Pelican][for-back].
And I really, really liked the smell.
Their website describe the smell as herbal citrus.
If it's edible, I would take a bite.
Sadly it's not.
But still, nice smells motivates me to take a bath on every chance.
