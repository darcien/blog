## Back to cycling

After few months of settling down here, and monitoring the used bike market...
I finally got a suitable road bike!

Now I'm trying to push my weekly ride to >5 hours, but it's not that easy :/
The weather here is seriously wild.
One day I went out thinking it was some light rain and wind.
1 hour later, it transformed to a 50 kmph wind and rainstorm.
Thanks to that, checking wind speed before going out is a must.

It's spring now, and initially I thought it's going to be warm and breezy.
Nah, next week is full of rain, and temp stays under 20°C.
I guess I'll wait for summer and start saving for indoor bike trainer.
