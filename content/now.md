## Winter is here?

I am now living in a place where the climate is pretty wild.
I thought room temperature of 25ÂºC was pretty cold before.
Nope, hot or cold is relative to your temperature tolerance.
Here, indoor temp easily goes under 20ÂºC during winter.
I'm trying hard to acclimatize, but wearing minimal layers doesn't seem
to do it fast enough.
I tried taking a cold shower, it feels like a torture.
So I'm doing it only when my mental can handle it.
Let's see where I am in few more months.
Can I reach the point where I can walk around in shorts and a t-shirt?

## Cycling, in this weather?

I miss cycling.
I didn't brought my bike with me.
So I'm looking buy one here.
Budget is tight though,
still looking for a good match in the second-hand market.
Torn between getting a cheapo commuter bike or a decent road bike.
