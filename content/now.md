## Recovering from sickness 

For the last week, the sore throat and runny nose is torturing me.
Keeping me awake at night some times.
I'm almost fully recovered though.
After holing up at home for a week or two, eating vitamins everyday.

## Cleared Pokemon Violet

I'm stuck at home because of the flu.
So I finally picked up Pokemon Violet again.
Which has been sitting in my library since last year, untouched.
The game is now actually playable!
Still has weird lag and freezes every now and then.
But otherwise much smoother compared to right after release.
End up clearing the game in 1-2 sittings in the weekend.
Also cleared the 7-star Blaziken raid.
Thanks random players who joined and helped clearing it!


## Tasty soap

I thought I don't really care about soap smell.
They're all soap right?
I was proven wrong.
Recently I tried using ["For Back" by Pelican][for-back].
And I really, really liked the smell.
Their website describe the smell as herbal citrus.
If it's edible, I would take a bite.
Sadly it's not.
But still, nice smells motivates me to take a bath on every chance.

## Bought some accessories

Some of my friends start talking about piercings.
And then I realized, nothing would stop me from getting one right now.
I've been holding off from getting any because of my skin conditions.
I really want to get one though.
Maybe this year will be the year.
For now I'll start small.
So I'm getting some cool stainless steel ring first.
Which is cheaper and easy to remove, compared to piercings.


## Watched [V.W.P and KAF Yoyogi 2024][yoyogi] live

[yoyogi]: https://yoyogiwars2024.kamitsubaki.jp/

As usual, KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO never fails to deliver.
The V.W.P live has a lot of new songs.
Still couldn't replace my favorite, "reincarnation", though.
The one with VALIS dancing on the top, and V.W.P with synthesizer
members singing is the most emotional part for me ðŸ¥¹.

As for the KAF live, the last part is a mystery to me.
Is that KAF?
She said she is KAIKA(å»»èŠ±)?
Is it like, KAIKA is in the real world,
and KAF is in the virtual world,
separating the two?
Ooh, exciting!
