## Back to (indoor) cycling

Spent part of 2023 running for exercises.
Turns out it's pretty fun!
But not when the air quality outside is bad.
Back to indoor cycling it is for 2024.
I need to prepare and train for Bromo KOM anyway
(assuming I got the ticket).

Update: I got the ticket!
Stayed awake at 3 a.m. to buy the ticket, totally worth it.

Update update: These days I spent my free time for cycling training.
I still am not confident in completing the Bromo KOM.
And the event is happening in 2 week (18 May 2024) ðŸ˜¬.

Oh well, whatever happens, I'll take care of it at that day.
For now, I just need to train, rest, repeat until the big day.

Once I'm done with it, it's time to take care of other live stuffs
that I have been pushing to the side for training.
