## Long, long time ago...

I've been drinking coffee almost every day for as long as I can remember.
I don't remember the exact reason, maybe copying my parents because they're
also avid coffee drinker?

When starting out, I drank the same coffee like my parents.
One of those commercial and cheap grounded coffee.
I didn't pay that much attention to the ingredients until later on.
Turns out what I've been drinking are not 100% coffee!
It contains a bunch of things I did not expect to be in a coffee, like
corn starch.

At some point I started buying real grounded coffee from local shop.
I thought I don't care the coffee type as long as it can be brewed into
black water.
After years of trying different coffee, maybe I can actually tell the
difference and have some preference?

And because there are so many of coffee variations,
I need a way to avoid the bad ones and keep tab on my favorites.

And now, here we are with a list of coffee I've tried and barely remember the tastes.

## Every grounded coffee I've ever bought (or remember)

Brand/Shop | Variant | Taste | Comment
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Northsider | Arabica Toraja Bittuang Natural | 😐 | -
Northsider | Black Onyx blend (Robusta Java, Arabica West Java & Aceh) | 😐 | -
Northsider | North blend (All Arabica: Columbia, Brazil, Ethiopia) | 😐 | -
Northsider | Razeta'55 blend (Arabica Brazil, Arabica Java, Robusta Java) | ❤️ | I've been buying this blend for more than a year straight, probably my favorite blend so far

I can barely remember the taste for some of the coffee in the list,
some are too acidic, some has that floral smell,
but I lost those notes.
So some of the taste and comments is kinda outdated until I bought them again for
curiosity.

## How did you make the coffee?

It's almost always pour over grounded coffee using paper filter.
I've been using the same Hario V60 dripper for years.

For the coffee, I use around 16g coffee for 3 servings.
Then grab whatever milk from the fridge, usually it's plain but it could be some
low-fat mochachino.
Pour the milk to the mug first.
Then pour the coffee, done!

(Maybe one day I'll upgrade my kit and include practicing making latte art 🤔)
