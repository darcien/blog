## Long, long time ago...

I've been drinking coffee almost every day for as long as I can remember.
I don't remember the exact reason, maybe copying my parents because they're
also avid coffee drinker?

When starting out, I drank the same coffee like my parents.
One of those commercial and cheap grounded coffee.
I didn't pay that much attention to the ingredients until later on.
Turns out what I've been drinking are not 100% coffee!
It contains a bunch of things I did not expect to be in a coffee, like
corn starch.

At some point I started buying real grounded coffee from local shop.
I thought I don't care the coffee type as long as it can be brewed into
black water.
After years of trying different coffee, maybe I can actually tell the
difference and have some preference?

And because there are so many of coffee variations,
I need a way to avoid the bad ones and keep tab on my favorites.

~And now, here we are with a list of coffee I've tried and barely remember the tastes.~
Over the past few years, I've made sure to keep track of new coffee.
So the tastes are from freshly brewed coffee now.


## Every grounded coffee I've ever bought

Country | Brand/Shop | Variant | Taste | Comment
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
🇦🇺 | Black Vice | Decaf blend (Colombia, Piedra Grande, Tolima + Pitalito, Hulia)  | 😌 | Wouldn't say I like the taste, but being decaf gives me reason to brew it at night!
🇦🇺 | Black Vice | Genesis dark roast blend (Colombia, Finca Villa Sofia + Nicaragua, La Cordillera) | 🤔 | Not quite the dark roast I'm expecting. Over the time it grows on me, but still not my ideal.
🇦🇺 | Black Vice | Hursty blend (Colombia, Andino Co-Op + Guatemala, Los Ancestros + Honduras, Edgar Urquia) | 🤨 | Has that slightly sweet aftertaste. Could be worse but this is not for me.
🇮🇩 | Excelso | Arabica Gold | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Excelso | Brazilian Santos | 😏 | It has that unique burnt coffee taste
🇮🇩 | Excelso | Kalosi Toraja | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Excelso | Robusta Gold | 😐 | -*
🇦🇺 | Inglewood | Bloom Seasonal Espresso blend (All Ethiopia: Hambela, Dikitu, Tulise) | 😔 | I realized I'm not a fan of Ethiopian coffee :(
🇦🇺 | Inglewood | Roosevelt blend (Brazil, Tanzania) | 🙂 | Okayish good, nothing remarkable
🇦🇺 | Inglewood | Sunset BLVD blend (Papua New Guinea, Peru, Chinese catimore) | 😐 | Meh, too bland for my taste
🇮🇩 | Kopi Boutique | Arabica Toraja Sulotco Sulawesi | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Kopi Boutique | Robusta Java Dampit | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Macehat | Arabica Sumatra Mandheling | 🤔 | Not a good latte material for me
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Aceh Gayo Wine | 🤢 | Well it kinda look like wine, but the taste, ugh I can't bear it, sorry
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Arabica Flores Bajawa Fully-washed | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Arabica Gunung Halu Banana Honey | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Arabica Ijen Blue Mountain Honey | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Arabica Java Malabar Red Honey | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Arabica Toraja Bittuang Natural | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Black Onyx blend (Robusta Java, Arabica West Java & Aceh) | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Classic blend (Robusta Dampit, Arabica Flores) | 😀 | Starting tad bland, but feels strong later on, not bad!
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Cold White blend (Robusta Temanggung, Arabica West Java & Gayo) | 😐 | -*
🇮🇩 | Northsider | North blend (All Arabica: Columbia, Brazil, Ethiopia) | 😐 | Feels weird at first, but it tastes just okay after a while.
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Razeta'55 blend (Arabica Brazil, Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) | ❤️ | I've been buying this blend for more than a year straight, probably my favorite blend so far.
🇮🇩 | Northsider | Sweet Gayo blend (Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) | 😊 | Just like the name suggests, it smells sweet. With milk, not so much, but I still like it.
🇮🇩 | Sido Mulia | Sido Mulia Premium (Robusta Dampit is my assumption) | 😐 | Meh, tastes like your usual bitter bland coffee. Not worth the premium price from this brand.
🇦🇺 | St. ALi | Orthodox blend (60% Colombia, 40% Brazil, Caturra + Colombia + Castillo + Red Bourbon) | 🙂 | Taste like the "coffee". Not too strong, not too bland, aptly named orthodox.
🇦🇺 | St. ALi | Wide Awake blend (60% Alta Mogiana, 40% Santa Ana) | 👍 | Good, real dark roast, but still can't beat dark field, something is missing.
🇦🇺 | Stitch Coffee | Dark Field blend | ❤️ | So far this is the best dark roast. Dark choco taste so good.

*) I can barely remember the taste for some of the coffee in the list,
some are too acidic, some has that floral smell,
but I lost those notes.
So some of the taste and comments is kinda outdated until I bought them again for
curiosity.

## Your coffee taste description sucks!

I know. I'm making this list to remind myself how a certain blend tastes like.
And it's totally different story when trying to describe how coffee tastes
to someone else.
I still need to work on that and have more descriptive report instead of just good vs not good.

At some point, I shared the list with friends,
and they said I should've put the tasting notes or profiles,
not just the beans and blend.
Oops, maybe for another future revision.

## Is latte an upgrade to coffee with milk?

My friend from the office offered me an old espresso machine he wants to get rid of.
He said it leaks on high pressure, otherwise it's still perfectly functional.
Well, why not? I accepted.

Yeah, just like what he said, the first few attempts fail spectacularly.
I suck at grinding the beans and adjusting the coffee amount.
I had to do 3 tries just to get coffee flowing out of the portafilter.

Now that I know the grind size needed and got better at eyeballing the coffee amount,
no more failed attempts!


## How did you make the coffee? (after October 2025)

The espresso machine is now my primary coffee source.
To be specific, it's a Sunbeam Cafe Series EM6910 (probably at least 10 y.o.).

Since it's an espresso machine, I have to start from beans.
(Otherwise all the coffee nerds around me will yell at me for not using fresh beans)

Grind the beans to espresso size.
Fill and stamp the portafilter until it's around ~3mm from the top of the container.
(I'm just following the machine manual, not sure if this is the "correct" way.)

Hit the 2 shots button while watching the pressure gauge.
Always the 2 shots because that's the only filter size I have inherited.

Pour 200 mL of milk and steam it using the steam wand.
Stop around 60ºC-ish.

Pour the milk to the coffee, making 2 cups of lattes, done!

## How did you make the coffee? (before October 2025)

It's almost always pour over grounded coffee using paper filter.
I've been using the same Hario V60 dripper for years.

For the coffee, I use around 16g coffee for 3 servings.
Then grab whatever milk from the fridge, usually it's plain but it could be some
low-fat mochachino.
Pour the milk to the mug first.
Then pour the coffee, done!

(Maybe one day I'll upgrade my kit and include practicing making latte art 🤔)


## How "fresh" is the roasted beans?

I've read/heard from people that using fresher roasted beans gives better coffee
tastes.
Honestly, I can't tell the differences.
As long as the coffee powder is still good, no mold etc., I have no complaints.

For example, these coffee from Northsider, I bought them at 24 October.
And from the packaging, it says production date is 17 October.
Assuming it's the roasting date, hey it only took 7 days from coffee beans
to ready to use coffee powder.
Fresh and enough for me.
Heck, it's way fresher than the coffee being enjoyed by these cool people in
Antarctica. One of their coffee is [3 years old][3-yo-coffee]!
