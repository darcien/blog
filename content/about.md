Hi there, my name is Yosua Ian Sebastian.
Currently I'm working as a software engineer in [KodeFox](https://kodefox.com/).

The main goals for this site are to practice my writing skills and keep some public notes that might benefit some people.

You could find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/darcien) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darcien_).
