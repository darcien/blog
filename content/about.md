Hi there, my name is Yosua Ian Sebastian.
Currently I'm working as a software engineer in [KodeFox](https://kodefox.com/).

In this site, probably you could find my ramblings about coffee and music I listen to, maybe some tech stuffs occasionaly.

You could find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/darcien) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darcien_).
