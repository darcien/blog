Hi there, my name is Yosua Ian Sebastian.
Currently I'm working as a software engineer to pay the bills and put food on the table for my parents.

Any writings on this site is my personal opinion and does not represent the view of my employer yada yada.

Initially I started this blog to practice writing, but it's not going really well.
This blog will probably end up as a daily life ramblings and (maybe) technical posts.

You could find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/darcien) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darcien_).
