Unlike other pages in this blog, this page act as information dump about myself
where I don't have to worry about writing useless sentences.

## How do I see myself?

- I used to think I'm a bit weird, turns out [everyone are](https://viruscomix.com/page500.html)!
- I consider myself really bad at communicating things, especially feelings.
- I feel like I'm lacking attachment to life.
- I feel like I'm too harsh on others or myself (sometimes).
- I'm one of those people that is really quiet at first then become noisy after getting familiar (sometimes).


## Food?

- I like potato and any potato derivatives ü•î.
- I like pasta.
- I love cheese roll.
- Fish? I like [bandeng][bandeng], salmon, and tuna.
- Fruits? I like pineapple, lemon, and banana. Apple is also kinda nice.
- I like stir fried beef with black pepper.
- I like salty snacks.
- Kue kering (cookies)? I like [nastar][nastar] and [kastengel][kastengel].
- Not a fan of spicy food.
- Prefer to avoid shady seafoods and mushrooms.

## Drinks?

Water, water, and water. Plain water is good for you.
When it's not water, I drink:
- [a hot cup of coffee with milk][coffee] almost daily.
  Might be up to 3 cups on stressful days.
- flavoured milk, like mochacinno or strawberry.
- black tea occasionally when I need to warm up my soul.
- cola, when I need that extra oomph in a day.
  Oooh all the sugars and soda rushing in ü´®

## Life philosophy?

> üöß Warning: I'm still in a neverending existential crisis,
> so this section might change like a rollercoaster ride over the time.

Recently I learnt about [stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)
through wikipedia, and I find it great on teaching me how to face life.
Knowing the principles and applying it are two different matters though.

[Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) is also a thing that
I learnt from [this article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-be-rational).

For now I'm trying to align myself with stoicism and rationalism.

## Life goals?

Oof, thats a hard question.
For now, I just want to be in a state where being alive doesn't feel like
living hell.
To achieve that, my strategies are:
- I need to accept what I have right now
- I should not be sad for things I don't have
- I should improve something day-by-day, whether it's living condition, knowledge, or fitness


## Music?

I listen to Japanese songs almost all the time.

My older sister listens to [Alice Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Nine)
years ago, maybe around 2009?
As the little brother who likes to copy what the older sibling does,
I started listening too and explored other Japanese band.
And that continues until now, I still listen to Japanese songs even
though I don't speak Japanese.

I don't have a specific genre I liked.
A good music is a good music, regardless of the genre (good based on my ears and brain).

If I had to mention one, maybe it's the type of song where at least 2 vocals
are singing at the same time with different lyrics.
In regular conversation, this kind of voice overlap is usually chaotic.
But in a good song composition, there is harmony in it, just like how multiple
instruments produce a good melody.
I think it's called [polyphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony) but I'm not too sure.

Some example songs are:
  - "Abysal Zone" by Nornis
  - "Ray of Hope" by Nornis
  - "divergence -Yumemiru Futari-" by Meramipop & nayuta
  - "ÂàπÈÇ£„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ" by „Å®„Åç„ÅÆ„Åù„Çâ & AZKi
  - "È§û„ÅÆÈ≥•" by D/Zeal

## Games?

- My favorite franchise is [Splatoon][splatoon] (probably).
  After that, there's [Pokemon][pokemon] and [Ys][ys].

- My nostalgia game is Pokemon Sapphire.

- I like roguelike game. e.g. [Risk of Rain][ror], [Risk of Rain 2][ror2],
  and [Dead Cells][deadcells].

- I like watching interactive drama game playthrough.
  Usually created by [Supermassive Games][supermassive] like Until Dawn and
  The Quarry.
  Watching, not playing, because I don't have a PS4.

- I used to collect games on Steam. At the time of writing, I have 1077 games.

- I used to spent a lot of hours in online games like [Grand Chase][grandchase],
  [Elsword][elsword], and [Warframe][warframe].
