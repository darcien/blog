Keeping track of things I'm using daily.

## Hardware

### Machines

- Office supplied MacBook Air M1 from 2020
- iPhone X from 2018
- ~~Raspberry Pi 2 Model B running Pi-hole, a relic from 2015~~ offline because I ran out of electric sockets
- MacBook 15" from 2015 for home server (Home Assistant etc.)
- A custom desktop with Intel i7-7700K, 32 GB of RAM, 512 GB NVMe SSD, 2 TB HDD,
  and GTX 1070. This thing has been reduced into a glorified video player
  and SSH client these days. Even the case power button is dead, so I need to
  use external button.

### Keyboard / Mouse

- [Logitech ERGO K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html):
  Bluetooth so I can use it on bike
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard 60 v2](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/)
  that I avoid to uses because my current place bad electricity grounding
  turn the metal frame into a mini stun gun
- [Endgame Gear XM1r mouse](https://www.endgamegear.com/en-us/xm1r/gaming-mice):
  a light (~70g) mouse
- [Logitech ERGO M575](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m575-ergo-wireless-trackball.910-005869.html)
  that I rarely use because it triggers my thumb joint inflammation on bad days

### Display

- ViewSonic XG2431, 24", IPS, a 240Hz-capable monitor that run on 50Hz for coding
- Dell U2417H, 24", IPS

### Audio

- [Audio Technica ATH-M50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-eu/ath-m50x) from 2016
- AfterShokz Aeropex AS800 bone conducting headset from 2021
- [Yamaha AG06](https://ca.yamaha.com/en/products/music_production/interfaces/ag_series/index.html):
  an overkill mixer to consolidate audio sources so I can hear them all at once.
- Sony SRS-XB10 Bluetooth speaker thats wired to the audio mixer all the time.
- [Samson Meteor Microphone](https://samsontech.com/products/microphones/usb-microphones/meteormic/)
  that rarely gets used these days because I sound the same as using a MacBook mic
  on calls.

### Others

- [APC BVX1200LI-MS][ups], a 1200VA UPS
- [AirGradient DIY Pro][airgradient], an air quality monitor
- [Smart Air Sqair][smartair], an air purifier
