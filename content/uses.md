Keeping track of things I'm using daily.

## Hardware

### Machines

- Office supplied MacBook Air M1 from 2020
- iPhone X from 2018
- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B running Pi-hole, a relic from 2015
- A custom desktop with Intel i7-7700K, 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB NVMe SSD, 2 TB HDD,
  and GTX 1070. This thing has been reduced into a glorified video player
  and SSH client these days

### Keyboard / Mouse

- [Logitech ERGO K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html):
  Bluetooth so I can use it on bike
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard 60 v2](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/)
  that I avoid to uses because my current place bad electricity grounding
  turn the metal frame into a mini stun gun
- [Endgame Gear XM1r mouse](https://www.endgamegear.com/en-us/xm1r/gaming-mice):
  a light (~70g) mouse
- [Logitech ERGO M575](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m575-ergo-wireless-trackball.910-005869.html)
  that I rarely use because it triggers my thumb joint inflammation on bad days

### Display

- ViewSonic XG2431, 24", IPS, a 240Hz-capable monitor that run on 50Hz for coding
- Dell U2417H, 24", IPS

### Audio

- [Audio Technica ATH-M50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-eu/ath-m50x) from 2016
- AfterShokz Aeropex AS800 bone conducting headset from 2021 for cycling
- [Yamaha AG06](https://ca.yamaha.com/en/products/music_production/interfaces/ag_series/index.html):
  an overkill mixer to consolidate audio sources so I can hear them all at once.
- Sony SRS-XB10 Bluetooth speaker thats wired to the audio mixer all the time.
- [Samson Meteor Microphone](https://samsontech.com/products/microphones/usb-microphones/meteormic/)
  that rarely gets used these days because I sound the same as using a MacBook mic
  on calls.

## Sport-ware? (mainly cycling)

### Bike
- [Polygon Strattos S3 road bike](https://www.rodalink.com/id/polygon-sepeda-strattos-s3-2017-31073.html),
  frame size 56 cm, a gift from my sister from 2018
  - Shimano Sora groupset
  - Shimano CS-HG50 12-25T 9-speed cassette
  - Continental Ultra Sport III tire because they have black-yellow tire matching with my bike color scheme

### Gears
- [Wahoo KICKR v5](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/08/wahoo-kickr-v5-2020-smart-trainer-in-depth-review.html) for indoor ride
