A list of questionable things I made over the time.

1. GraphQL server for [Starlight Stage API](https://starlight.kirara.ca/)
   
    It's available on [starlight.darcien.dev/graphql](https://starlight.darcien.dev/graphql).
    I made it for learning GraphQL, so I made it without the consent of the API owner. 
    (Triangle-sama, please forgive me for this 🙏)
