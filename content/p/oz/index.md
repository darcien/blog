I thought being invited to attend the Christmas party was a joke.
My employer is based in Sydney, Australia.
And I'm just a measly contractor living in Indonesia.
Turns out they're serious.
They sent me flight and hotel booking details!

After clicking a bunch of buttons in Australia's Immi website for visa,
hunting translators for translating official documents,
and buying new luggage,
I'm ready to go.
The clothes I brought mostly consists of thin T-shirts for summer.
(Only later on I realized Australia's summer is pretty cold for me ðŸ¥¶)

## Day 1 - Arriving in Sydney

It's a 7 hours flight from Jakarta to Sydney.
When I arrived, it's slightly windy and drizzling.
My engineering manager who's a Melbourne local said, "yeah it's pretty warm today".
I was like ðŸ™„.
The weather in Sydney is weird.
