## Platforms

### eplus

Link: https://ib.eplus.jp

Last watched: 2023-03-18, hololive 4th fes

Rating: avoid if possible üëé

Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unuseable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.

### hololive official fanclub (subscribe only with no one time ticket, kinda counts)

Link: https://hololive-fc.com

Last watched: 2023-06-21, variety show with Asaka as guest

Rating: decent but no choice on exclusive content üòê
(Firefox user: bad site üëé)

A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Suprisingly decent considering it's their own platform
and doesn't have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer[^hololive-fc-dwango].

Their website feels weird though with all commenters' name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.

Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30[^hololive-fc-firefox].
Which is a sad thing, but not a dealbreaker.

### Niconico (Dwango)

Link: https://live.nicovideo.jp

Last watched: 2023-03-15, Nornis 1st live

Rating: paid for video, only got the audio üò≠

Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it's great.
Pratically, I can't like it.

Last time I watched Nornis' live, it's still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don't know if what's causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subsribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).

### SPWN

Link: https://virtual.spwn.jp

Last watched: 2022-03-20, hololive 3rd fes

Rating: pretty safe choice if available üëç

So far the most platform I've been using and has the least problem with.
From time to time has bad connection to Indo
even after turning on low latency mode on their video player.

### YouTube (member only live, kinda counts)

Link: https://youtube.com

Last watched: pretty much every month

Rating: probably the live you want to watch is not here üòî

It's YouTube.
They probaby have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.

But they don't run ticketing for one-time watch.

### Z-aN

Link: https://www.zan-live.com

Last watched: 2023-06-17, Planet Station stage 8

Rating: my new go to platform ü´∂
(Firefox user: Booo, please fix the video player ü§ï)

First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.

My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.

## Backstory

Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
So I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there's no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it's 2, it's pick bad or the less bad one ü•≤.
