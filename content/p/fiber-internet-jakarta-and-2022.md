Today is the last day of 2022.
Internet connection is already close being a public utility.
And here I am, having a hard time trying to find decent ISP that can provides service to my place.

I've been trying to change providers since at least 4 months ago.
And this effort will probably continue to 2023.

## Provider Checklist

I'm looking at these things while looking for ISP:

- Available at my place (duh)
- Sane pricing, I'm not going to pay for enterprise pricing
- No scummy practice (ok, maybe at least minimal, none at all is unlikely to exists)
- Use fiber connection or better
- No weird quota or policy on rate limiting
- Good uptime (it's 2022, please don't timeout when it's raining)

And these are nice to have but not required:

- Internet only (no, I do not want to subscribe to your whatever TV/CCTV/streaming services)
- Bring-my-own-modem or at least don't charge me with overpriced modem rent per month to the point I can buy the modem 4 times a year
- IPv6 support (is this even a thing in Indonesia?)

Here I go, checking every single ISP that provides fiber connection and operates in Indonesia.
Like every single one of them, from "every person know this name" to "is that an actual service name?".

## Is it available in my place?

\*: indonet seems to only offer enterprise plan, I'm not going to contact their sales for checking that.

\*\*: MNC Play requires me to fill a form with personal identification etc. to check for coverage area.
I already did that with another ISP, got a lot of spam calls and no coverage, no thanks.
