summary: "Tried changing package type to gift to reduce import tax, it's not very effective."
---

I bought more goods from BOOTH.pm for the who knows how many time.
But this time felt a bit cheaper, not sure if I got used to it or it's actually cheaper.
Time to write it for comparison then!

The main differences with the usual are:
- I changed the package type to "gift". The default type is "other" for mine.
- I picked EMS instead of DHL this time to shave off few hundred yens.
- I did not request package consolidation, so each goods are shipped individually from Japan to me.

## The numbers

| Goods                      | Price (JPY) | Shipping local (JPY) | Shipping intl (JPY) | Weight (g) | Dimensions (cm) | Import tax (IDR) |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Acrylic figure (~15cm)     | 2200        | 370                  | 1900                | 120        | 32 × 26 × 1     | 95950            |
| B2 Tapestry (double suede) | 7000        | 880                  | 1900                | 300        | 10 × 10 × 54    | 192950           |


## Calculations

For calculation I will use today's exchange rate for simplication.
Today (2023-09-07) it is 1 JPY = 104 IDR.

### Acrylic figure

Total paid = (2200 + 370 + 1900) * 104 + 95950

Total paid = 464880 + 95950

Total paid = 560830 IDR

### B2 tapestry

Total paid = (7000 + 880 + 1900) * 104 + 192950

Total paid = 1017120 + 192950

Total paid = 1210070 IDR

## Comparison

I'm using the prices from previous BOOTH.pm [purchase post](../actual-prices-for-goods-from-booth.md) for comparison.
That one only have acrylic figure though, I have not bought tapestry recently.

From that post, the acrylic figure cost 551.441 IDR with tax included,
sent via DHL, and were consolidated with other goods.

Compared to this time which costs 560.830 IDR, the difference is just 9.389 IDR.
Thats peanuts.

## Conclusion

The price did not drop that much even though I expect setting "gift" to package
type would reduce the tax.
Which makes sense because majority of the price came from shipping that costs
more than the goods itself (2200 < 370 + 1900).

I need to adjust my buying strategy based on the goods vs shipping price.
I want to pay even less!

I still don't understand how to calculate import tax on my own.
Or how Indonesia's post office does not always give me this tax receipt.
At least these days they have package notifications via WhatsApp business account.
