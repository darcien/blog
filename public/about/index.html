I feel like I‚Äôm too harsh on others or myself (sometimes). I‚Äôm one of those people that is really quiet at first then become noisy after getting familiar (sometimes). Food? I like potato and any potato derivatives ü•î. I like pasta. I love cheese roll. Fish? I like bandeng, salmon, and tuna. Fruits? I like pineapple, lemon, and banana. Apple is also kinda nice. I like stir fried beef with black pepper. I like salty snacks. Kue kering (cookies)? I like nastar and kastengel. Not a fan of spicy food. Prefer to avoid shady seafoods and mushrooms. Drinks? Water, water, and water. Plain water is good for you. When it‚Äôs not water, I drink:\na hot cup of coffee with milk almost daily. Might be up to 3 cups on stressful days. flavoured milk, like mochacinno or strawberry. black tea occasionally when I need to warm up my soul. cola, when I need that extra oomph in a day.

Knowing the principles and applying it are two different matters though.\nRationalism is also a thing that I learnt from this article.\nFor now I‚Äôm trying to align myself with stoicism and rationalism.\nLife goals? Oof, thats a hard question. For now, I just want to be in a state where being alive doesn‚Äôt feel like living hell. To achieve that, my strategies are:\nI need to accept what I have right now I should not be sad for things I don‚Äôt have I should improve something day-by-day, whether it‚Äôs living condition, knowledge, or fitness Music? I listen to Japanese songs almost all the time.\nMy older sister listens to Alice Nine years ago, maybe around 2009? As the little brother who likes to copy what the older sibling does, I started listening too and explored other Japanese band. And that continues until now, I still listen to Japanese songs even though I don‚Äôt speak Japanese.\nI don‚Äôt have a specific genre I liked. A good music is a good music, regardless of the genre (good based on my ears and brain).\nIf I had to mention one, maybe it‚Äôs the type of song where at least 2 vocals are singing at the same time with different lyrics. In regular conversation, this kind of voice overlap is usually chaotic. But in a good song composition, there is harmony in it, just like how multiple instruments produce a good melody. I think it‚Äôs called polyphony but I‚Äôm not too sure.\nSome example songs are:\n‚ÄúAbysal Zone‚Äù by Nornis ‚ÄúRay of Hope‚Äù by Nornis ‚Äúdivergence -Yumemiru Futari-‚Äù by Meramipop \u0026 nayuta ‚ÄúÂàπÈÇ£„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ‚Äù by „Å®„Åç„ÅÆ„Åù„Çâ \u0026 AZKi ‚ÄúÈ§û„ÅÆÈ≥•‚Äù by D/Zeal Games? My favorite franchise is Splatoon (probably). After that, there‚Äôs Pokemon and Ys.\nMy nostalgia game is Pokemon Sapphire.\nI like roguelike game. e.g. Risk of Rain, Risk of Rain 2, and Dead Cells.\nI like watching interactive drama game playthrough. Usually created by Supermassive Games like Until Dawn and The Quarry. Watching, not playing, because I don‚Äôt have a PS4.\nI used to collect games on Steam. At the time of writing, I have 1077 games.\nI used to spent a lot of hours in online games like Grand Chase, Elsword, and Warframe.\nRandom facts? I am born in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1997 during the financial crisis. I have never met nor seen both of my grandfathers ever, even as a baby. My first name, Yosua, is not given by my parents. I dropped out of college to focus on working as my parents are retired or don‚Äôt work for health reasons. I‚Äôve been working as software engineer since 2018. I‚Äôve been working from home since 2019. I hiked Mt. Semeru (3676m) as my first mountain, reached the top and survived!
