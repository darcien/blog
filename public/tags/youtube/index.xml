I&rsquo;m not entitled to any of it&rsquo;s features.
But it&rsquo;s still frustating when a button or dropdown is not there when I want to click on it.</p>
<p>Few months ago they removed the ability to sort from the oldest video in a channel.
Leaving only sort alphabetically and from the most popular video.
So if I I&rsquo;m interested in a channel and want to see the older videos, I need to scroll all the way to the bottom, loading every videos in-between.</p>
<p>But now, the dropdown itself is gone!
No more channel videos sort for me.</p>
<p>Is it a technical limitation?
Operating at the scale of YouTube would probably have problems I&rsquo;ll never encounter in my whole life.</p>
<p>Or is it decided by the higher ups after looking at some numbers?
An arbitrary decision because only small percentage of the users click on the dropdown.</p>
<p>I probably will never know why they removed the sort dropdown.</p>
<p>Or why they keep changing the border radius.</p>
<p>Or why they reintroduced the dark theme as &ldquo;ambient mode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Or why they keep stuffing things in channel name row when watching a video, so I can only see 5 chars of the channel name and 6 buttons in the same row.</p>
<p>Or why they make only 8 playlists visible at a time when saving a video. At least give me an inline search or show a bigger modal.</p>
<p>Or why they keep pushing for Shorts to my face.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe is that they never communicate most of these changes.
One day you open the website and part of the website just changed.
It could be a slap-in-the-face or did-this-text-size-increase-by-one-px kind.
You&rsquo;ll never know until you checked it.</p>
