I&rsquo;ve included my rough take on each platform and the dates.
Over the time these list might get outdated as the streaming platform keep updating their site.</p>

<p>Last watched: 2023-03-18, hololive 4th fes</p>
<p>Rating: avoid if possible üëé</p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unuseable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>

<p>Last watched: 2023-06-21, variety show with Asaka as guest</p>
<p>Rating: decent but no choice on exclusive content üòê
(Firefox user: bad site üëé)</p>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Suprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a dealbreaker.</p>
<h2 id="niconico-dwango">Niconico (Dwango)</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://live.nicovideo.jp">https://live.nicovideo.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2023-03-15, Nornis 1st live</p>
<p>Rating: paid for video, only got the audio üò≠</p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Pratically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subsribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>
<h2 id="spwn">SPWN</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://virtual.spwn.jp">https://virtual.spwn.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2022-03-20, hololive 3rd fes</p>
<p>Rating: pretty safe choice if available üëç</p>
<p>So far the most platform I&rsquo;ve been using and has the least problem with.
From time to time has bad connection to Indo
even after turning on low latency mode on their video player.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-member-only-live-kinda-counts">YouTube (member only live, kinda counts)</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://youtube.com">https://youtube.com</a></p>
<p>Last watched: pretty much every month</p>
<p>Rating: probably the live you want to watch is not here üòî</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s YouTube.
They probaby have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t run ticketing for one-time watch.</p>
<h2 id="z-an">Z-aN</h2>

<li>2023-09-03, KOKO 2nd ONE-MAN LIVE &ldquo;PLAYER II - Kamitsubaki City AREA 4 -&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Rating: my new go to platform ü´∂</p>
<h3 id="first-impression-2023-06-17">First impression (2023-06-17)</h3>
<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<h3 id="current-impression-2023-09-03">Current impression (2023-09-03)</h3>
<p>Still my favourite platform, everything from my first impression still applies
(assuming the site isn&rsquo;t down if they&rsquo;re hosting a big event with &gt;100k viewers).
And they even fixed the errors on Firefox.</p>
<p>On 2023-08-26, their site couldn&rsquo;t handle the load from Hololive Splash Party though.
The live postponed live that day never happened.
It become a recording distributed on YouTube and the live ticket refunded.
I did not expect them to fail that bad.
Live viewers count should be under 200k from my estimates.</p>
<p>Also saw nginx error page from their site that day.
Weird feeling but I feel relaxed after realizing they also use some familiar tech in their stack.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated to the platform itself but I have to say this:
if you&rsquo;re even remotely interested with the idea of a virtual singer singing
cool songs in a future dystopian world, you need to watch <a href="https://www.zan-live.com/en/live/detail/10322">this live</a>.
It&rsquo;s AMAZING and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
<p><del>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</del>
They fixed it as of 2023-08-27! Hooray ü•≥</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
As these live streams ticket aren&rsquo;t exactly cheap,
I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one ü•≤.</p>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
<p>2023-09-03: updated Z-aN entry, added KOKO one-man live pic</p>
<p>2023-06-17: initial page</p>

I&rsquo;m not entitled to any of it&rsquo;s features.
But it&rsquo;s still frustating when a button or dropdown is not there when I want to click on it.</p>
<p>Few months ago they removed the ability to sort from the oldest video in a channel.
Leaving only sort alphabetically and from the most popular video.
So if I I&rsquo;m interested in a channel and want to see the older videos, I need to scroll all the way to the bottom, loading every videos in-between.</p>
<p>But now, the dropdown itself is gone!
No more channel videos sort for me.</p>
<p>Is it a technical limitation?
Operating at the scale of YouTube would probably have problems I&rsquo;ll never encounter in my whole life.</p>
<p>Or is it decided by the higher ups after looking at some numbers?
An arbitrary decision because only small percentage of the users click on the dropdown.</p>
<p>I probably will never know why they removed the sort dropdown.</p>
<p>Or why they keep changing the border radius.</p>
<p>Or why they reintroduced the dark theme as &ldquo;ambient mode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Or why they keep stuffing things in channel name row when watching a video, so I can only see 5 chars of the channel name and 6 buttons in the same row.</p>
<p>Or why they make only 8 playlists visible at a time when saving a video. At least give me an inline search or show a bigger modal.</p>
<p>Or why they keep pushing for Shorts to my face.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe is that they never communicate most of these changes.
One day you open the website and part of the website just changed.
It could be a slap-in-the-face or did-this-text-size-increase-by-one-px kind.
You&rsquo;ll never know until you checked it.</p>
