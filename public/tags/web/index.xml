<p>🔖 Assumed post audience: someone who wants to watch concert/3D live online
but not sure which host to pick (if choices exists).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are non-exhaustive list of platforms that I&rsquo;ve watched on before.
I&rsquo;ve included my rough take on each platform and the dates.
Over the time these list might get outdated as the streaming platform keep updating their site.</p>
<h2 id="asobi-stage">ASOBI STAGE</h2>
<p>Note: ASOBI STAGE is different with ASOBI CHANNEL.
ASOBI CHANNEL is more like YouTube, free to watch platform,
and has different set of issues with ASOBI STAGE.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: totally worth it to watch Idolm@ster live in real time!</strong></p>
<p>The platform is pretty good, there are no major problems.
There are hiccups where video does not play but comments keep flowing,
but a refresh or two fixed it.
Also the light stick below the video player is a really nice touch.
And the fact you can control it with your phone is a proof they&rsquo;re putting
a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>Archive also works great, their viewing period is a bit short though,
around 2 weeks or so.</p>
<p>A slight annoyance: the comments section often stop scrolling midway during live,
scrolling manually to the bottom can fix it.
But often it also scrolls the main view instead of just the comment section.
Not sure if this is specific to my environment or not.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: avoid if possible 👎</strong></p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unusable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: service has been discontinued, nothing new here 🤷</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression">Latest impression</h3>
<p>No issue from the streaming side.
But the way they handle the end of service wasn&rsquo;t great.
There&rsquo;s only 2-3 months gap between <a href="https://hololive-fc.com/articles/news/arxj4MUHg3YRL5gyBny6NPWU">the announcement</a> (2023-11-30) and the closure (2024-01).
And no partial refunds for those paying annual subscriptions.
Sure now they&rsquo;re hosting all the contents for free now,
but there&rsquo;s no way these archives will be hosted online forever.</p>
<p>Now hololive is hosting their exclusive content on YouTube membership instead.</p>
<p>(Also their announcement page doesn&rsquo;t load when opened from Internet Archive.
Which means their website kinda sucks according to my personal standards.)</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-06-18">Previous impression (2023-06-18)</h3>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Surprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a deal breaker.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: video stream quality sucks, archive not included 😭</strong></p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Practically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subscribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>

<h3 id="latest-impression-2022-ish">Latest impression (2022-ish)</h3>

</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: works great except for the occasional stutters</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2024-05-05">Latest impression (2024-05-05)</h3>
<p>Honestly I forgot about this site until I tried to buy a new ticket this year.
Then I realized I have an account already in my password manager.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember anything noteworthy from the first impression.
Which is a good sign, no major issue back then.</p>
<p>But during the FLORIST live, there are stutters.
And it&rsquo;s the type where the stream repeats the stuttered part.
e.g. lyrics: one two three, stream: one two two three.
&ldquo;Hmm, is it a remix? I don&rsquo;t remember this part&rdquo; is what I initially thought.
Turns out no, it was stream issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see change in graphic quality during stutters.
So I doubt it&rsquo;s caused by the &ldquo;auto&rdquo; quality in the video player settings.
Which should result in video downgrade if the player decides to lower the quality
during the stutter.
I also don&rsquo;t see the stutters during archive playback.</p>
<p>Other than that stutters, Zaiko works great.</p>
<p>Some neutral stuffs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hovering cursor on seek bar in archive give visual preview, which is great.
Not every platform has this basic stuff.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no live chat replay in archive?
I don&rsquo;t really read the chat, but it sure feels weird looking at empty chats
during archive.</li>

<p><strong>Verdict: superb, my first choice these days 🌟 (assuming it&rsquo;s not hololive event)</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2024-12-28">Latest impression (2024-12-28)</h3>
<p>At this point, I believe troubles doesn&rsquo;t exist for Kamitsubaki x Z-an combination.
Smooth live, good video and audio quality, works on Firefox, and watch archive works!
(Even during ~8 hours long stream, it&rsquo;s relatively smooth)</p>
<p>I also tried from Firefox + Linux and Safari + iPadOS combination,
they&rsquo;re superb!</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-13">Previous impression (2023-09-13)</h3>
<p>Watched yet another big event, and there&rsquo;s a blackout mid stream.
No sound, no video.
They said the troubles only last 90s, but it felt like forever<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
With the live comments still running, I saw a lot of frustrated comments.
That makes me feel sad.
It was a theatrical type event and setting the mood was pretty important.
And the blackout ruined the mood buildup for me.</p>
<p>With all the recent troubles, I&rsquo;m starting to lose faith in Z-aN 🙁</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-03">Previous impression (2023-09-03)</h3>
<p>Still my favorite platform, everything from my first impression still applies
(assuming the site isn&rsquo;t down if they&rsquo;re hosting a big event with &gt;100k viewers).
And they even fixed the errors on Firefox.</p>
<p>On 2023-08-26, their site couldn&rsquo;t handle the load from Hololive Splash Party though<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
The live postponed live that day never happened.
It become a recording distributed on YouTube and the live ticket refunded.
I did not expect them to fail that bad.
Live viewers count should be under 200k from my estimates.</p>
<p>Also saw nginx error page from their site that day.
Weird feeling but I feel relaxed after realizing they also use some familiar tech in their stack.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated to the platform itself but I have to say this:
if you&rsquo;re even remotely interested with the idea of a virtual singer singing
cool songs in a future dystopian world, you need to watch <a href="https://www.zan-live.com/en/live/detail/10322">this live</a>.
It&rsquo;s AMAZING and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<h3 id="first-impression-2023-06-17">First impression (2023-06-17)</h3>
<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<p><del>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</del>
They fixed it as of 2023-08-27! Hooray 🥳</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-write-this">Why did you write this?</h2>
<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
As these live streams ticket aren&rsquo;t exactly cheap,
I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one 🥲.</p>

I&rsquo;m not entitled to any of it&rsquo;s features.
But it&rsquo;s still frustating when a button or dropdown is not there when I want to click on it.</p>
<p>Few months ago they removed the ability to sort from the oldest video in a channel.
Leaving only sort alphabetically and from the most popular video.
So if I I&rsquo;m interested in a channel and want to see the older videos, I need to scroll all the way to the bottom, loading every videos in-between.</p>
<p>But now, the dropdown itself is gone!
No more channel videos sort for me.</p>
<p>Is it a technical limitation?
Operating at the scale of YouTube would probably have problems I&rsquo;ll never encounter in my whole life.</p>
<p>Or is it decided by the higher ups after looking at some numbers?
An arbitrary decision because only small percentage of the users click on the dropdown.</p>
<p>I probably will never know why they removed the sort dropdown.</p>
<p>Or why they keep changing the border radius.</p>
<p>Or why they reintroduced the dark theme as &ldquo;ambient mode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Or why they keep stuffing things in channel name row when watching a video, so I can only see 5 chars of the channel name and 6 buttons in the same row.</p>
<p>Or why they make only 8 playlists visible at a time when saving a video. At least give me an inline search or show a bigger modal.</p>
<p>Or why they keep pushing for Shorts to my face.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe is that they never communicate most of these changes.
One day you open the website and part of the website just changed.
It could be a slap-in-the-face or did-this-text-size-increase-by-one-px kind.
You&rsquo;ll never know until you checked it.</p>
