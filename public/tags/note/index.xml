I&rsquo;ve included my rough take on each platform and the dates.
Over the time these list might get outdated as the streaming platform keep updating their site.</p>
<h2 id="eplus">eplus</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://ib.eplus.jp">https://ib.eplus.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2023-03-18, hololive 4th fes</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: avoid if possible üëé</strong></p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unuseable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>
<h2 id="hololive-official-fanclub-subscribe-only-with-no-one-time-ticket-kinda-counts">hololive official fanclub (subscribe only with no one time ticket, kinda counts)</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://hololive-fc.com">https://hololive-fc.com</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2023-06-21, variety show with Asaka as guest</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: decent but no choice on exclusive content üòê</strong>
(Firefox user: bad site üëé)</p>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Suprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a dealbreaker.</p>
<h2 id="niconico-dwango">Niconico (Dwango)</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://live.nicovideo.jp">https://live.nicovideo.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2023-03-15, Nornis 1st live</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: video stream quality sucks, archive not included üò≠</strong></p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Pratically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subsribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>
<h2 id="spwn">SPWN</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://virtual.spwn.jp">https://virtual.spwn.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2022-03-20, hololive 3rd fes</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: pretty safe choice if available üëç</strong></p>
<p>So far the most platform I&rsquo;ve been using and has the least problem with.
From time to time has bad connection to Indo
even after turning on low latency mode on their video player.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-member-only-live-kinda-counts">YouTube (member only live, kinda counts)</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://youtube.com">https://youtube.com</a></p>
<p>Last watched: pretty much every month</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: probably the live you want to watch is not here üòî</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s YouTube.
They probaby have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t run ticketing for one-time watch.</p>
<h2 id="z-an">Z-aN</h2>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.zan-live.com">https://www.zan-live.com</a></p>
<p>Previously watched:</p>
<ul>
<li>2023-06-17, Planet Station stage 8</li>
<li>2023-08-27, Hololive Splash Party</li>
<li>2023-09-03, KOKO 2nd ONE-MAN LIVE &ldquo;PLAYER II - Kamitsubaki City AREA 4 -&rdquo;</li>
<li>2023-09-13, Blue Journey 1st Live &ldquo;Yoake no Uta&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: great when it&rsquo;s working, but unstable lately üò¨</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2023-09-13">Latest impression (2023-09-13)</h3>
<p>Watched yet another big event, and there&rsquo;s a blackout mid stream.
No sound, no video.
They said the troubles only last 90s, but it felt like forever<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
With the live comments still running, I saw a lot of frustrated comments.
That makes me feel sad.
It was a theatrical type event and setting the mood was pretty important.
And the blackout ruined the mood buildup for me.</p>
<p>With all the recent troubles, I&rsquo;m starting to lose faith in Z-aN üôÅ</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-03">Previous impression (2023-09-03)</h3>
<p>Still my favourite platform, everything from my first impression still applies
(assuming the site isn&rsquo;t down if they&rsquo;re hosting a big event with &gt;100k viewers).
And they even fixed the errors on Firefox.</p>
<p>On 2023-08-26, their site couldn&rsquo;t handle the load from Hololive Splash Party though<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
The live postponed live that day never happened.
It become a recording distributed on YouTube and the live ticket refunded.
I did not expect them to fail that bad.
Live viewers count should be under 200k from my estimates.</p>
<p>Also saw nginx error page from their site that day.
Weird feeling but I feel relaxed after realizing they also use some familiar tech in their stack.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated to the platform itself but I have to say this:
if you&rsquo;re even remotely interested with the idea of a virtual singer singing
cool songs in a future dystopian world, you need to watch <a href="https://www.zan-live.com/en/live/detail/10322">this live</a>.
It&rsquo;s AMAZING and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<h3 id="first-impression-2023-06-17">First impression (2023-06-17)</h3>
<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<p><del>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</del>
They fixed it as of 2023-08-27! Hooray ü•≥</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
As these live streams ticket aren&rsquo;t exactly cheap,
I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one ü•≤.</p>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

Also works as a timecapsule letter, dear future me, don&amp;rsquo;t repeat these mistakes.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="monitors-used">Monitors Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dell U2417H [24&quot; 60Hz IPS Monitor]</li>
<li>ViewSonic XG2431 [24&quot; 240Hz IPS Monitor]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="macos--viewsonic-issues">MacOS + ViewSonic Issues</h2>
<p>Can&rsquo;t use random USB-C cable + USB hub for connecting ViewSonic to M1 MacBook Air running Big Sur.</p>
<p>Mac detected the monitor, but monitor show &ldquo;no signal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe cable or hub issue? Used the same exact cable and hub with different monitor, worked.</p>
<p>Maybe monitor port issue? Used same HDMI port with Windows desktop, worked.</p>
<p>Then I found this review on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/R19FF79H8JO7G9/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07JVKS8JQ">Amazon</a> for different ViewSonic model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other reviewers here have noted all the pros about this monitor, I will just add that 1-) the adjustable stand is especially easy to use and useful for long hours and avoiding neck pain and 2-) reminder that they ship only a display port/USB cable and an HDMI cable with it even though monitor is USB -C enabled. if you are running Mojave 10.14 or later the adapters for display port and HDMI simply will not work, the mac book will never see the monitor. You <em>must</em> get a USB-C 3.1 to C cable. Then you can just plug it all in. Also need to add a shout out to Anne at Amazon (complimentary) tech support for helping figure all this out by coordinating with ViewSonic because it wasn&rsquo;t documented anywhere at the point at which I was trying to do it. Thank you Anne!</p>
<ul>
<li>bookkook, 2019 March</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Hey, that problem sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So I just learned there&rsquo;s a lot of USB-C variant, and USB-C 3.1 gen 2 is a thing.</p>
<p>Currently ordering a new cable, will update later.</p>
<p>Update: It&rsquo;s 2022 and I bought a new cable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ventioncable.com/product/usb-c-to-hdmi-cable-2/">HDMI to USB-C from Vention</a>.
Surprise! It worked! I&rsquo;ll skip the story of the package courier miss-deliver the cable and I had to buy it twice.</p>
<p>After using it a full day without problems, I realized a fatal miss when it&rsquo;s time to charge the laptop.
Macbook air only have 2 USB-C ports! 1 for monitor, and the other one for USB hub, this is for keyboard etc. and I can&rsquo;t work without it.</p>
<p>Okay, back to square one. I tried rummaging through my jumbled mess cable collection and found a HDMI to HDMI cable.
Not sure where it&rsquo;s from, maybe from Nintendo Switch.
It looks exactly like your average HDMI cable, and it&rsquo;s pretty old, but there&rsquo;s no harm in trying it right?</p>
<p>Another surprise! I have zero idea why, but connecting that old HDMI cable to the USB Hub and it worked! Mac could properly detect the monitor now.
The only thing I can identify from the cable is E202584 AWM from a company called Linkiss.</p>
<p>In a way, I wasted a total of IDR 319K for unused cables and few hours to look into the cause.
What I learnt from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no idea how HDMI works</li>
<li>I have even less idea how USB C works</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows--monitors-with-mixed-hdr-mode">Windows + Monitors with Mixed HDR Mode</h2>
<p>Windows 10 with multi-monitor, but only some of them have support HDR.</p>
<p>If HDR is enabled on supported monitors, this will break preview feature from Windows on non-HDR monitor. E.g. win+tab will show black desktop and windows, hovering on running program from taskbar will show black window instead of actual preview.</p>
<p>Solution, turn off HDR :(</p>
