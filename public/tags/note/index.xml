<p>These are non-exhaustive list of platforms that I&rsquo;ve watched on before.
I&rsquo;ve included my rough take on each platform and the dates.
Over the time these list might get outdated as the streaming platform keep updating their site.</p>

<p>Note: ASOBI STAGE is different with ASOBI CHANNEL.
ASOBI CHANNEL is more like YouTube, free to watch platform,
and has different set of issues with ASOBI STAGE.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: totally worth it to watch Idolm@ster live in real time!</strong></p>
<h3 id="2025-notes">2025 notes</h3>
<p>Sometimes the 1080p stutters. BUT, there&rsquo;s 1062p option.
That&rsquo;s not a resolution option I usually see, but it looks good enough,
and it doesn&rsquo;t stutter!</p>
<h3 id="2024-impression">2024 impression</h3>
<p>The platform is pretty good, there are no major problems.
There are hiccups where video does not play but comments keep flowing,
but a refresh or two fixed it.
Also the light stick below the video player is a really nice touch.
And the fact you can control it with your phone is a proof they&rsquo;re putting
a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>Archive also works great, their viewing period is a bit short though,
around 2 weeks or so.</p>
<p>A slight annoyance: the comments section often stop scrolling midway during live,
scrolling manually to the bottom can fix it.
But often it also scrolls the main view instead of just the comment section.
Not sure if this is specific to my environment or not.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: avoid if possible 👎</strong></p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unusable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: service has been discontinued, nothing new here 🤷</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression">Latest impression</h3>
<p>No issue from the streaming side.
But the way they handle the end of service wasn&rsquo;t great.
There&rsquo;s only 2-3 months gap between <a href="https://hololive-fc.com/articles/news/arxj4MUHg3YRL5gyBny6NPWU">the announcement</a> (2023-11-30) and the closure (2024-01).
And no partial refunds for those paying annual subscriptions.
Sure now they&rsquo;re hosting all the contents for free now,
but there&rsquo;s no way these archives will be hosted online forever.</p>
<p>Now hololive is hosting their exclusive content on YouTube membership instead.</p>
<p>(Also their announcement page doesn&rsquo;t load when opened from Internet Archive.
Which means their website kinda sucks according to my personal standards.)</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-06-18">Previous impression (2023-06-18)</h3>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Surprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a deal breaker.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: video stream quality sucks, archive not included 😭</strong></p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Practically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subscribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: okay-ish website and has DRM protection for the stream</strong></p>
<h3 id="impression">Impression</h3>
<p>Video streaming itself is okay, basic funcionality is there.
No stream quality issue too.
Theater mode hides the chat for some reason, but that&rsquo;s just my pet peeve.
For the event I watched, the archive is available for 1 week.</p>
<p>But the stream itself is DRM protected.
So, no archival (yet) for this one.
Looking at the manifest, it&rsquo;s CENC.
Seems like there&rsquo;s an <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/11167">open PR for it</a> in yt-dlp,
might be doable in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of streaming, the user registration is really bad.
I had to register twice, on iccomotto.com and stagecrowd.live.
I think it&rsquo;s because the event is limited to FC only,
which is another paid subscription.
(I probably could figure it out if read everything,
but I just want to watch these 2 events.)
And both registration requires JP address and phone number.
Why would you need all these just to watch an online live stream? 😣</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: probably the live you want to watch is not here 😔</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s YouTube.
They probably have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t run ticketing for one-time watch.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: works great except for the occasional stutters</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2024-05-05">Latest impression (2024-05-05)</h3>
<p>Honestly I forgot about this site until I tried to buy a new ticket this year.
Then I realized I have an account already in my password manager.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember anything noteworthy from the first impression.
Which is a good sign, no major issue back then.</p>
<p>But during the FLORIST live, there are stutters.
And it&rsquo;s the type where the stream repeats the stuttered part.
e.g. lyrics: one two three, stream: one two two three.
&ldquo;Hmm, is it a remix? I don&rsquo;t remember this part&rdquo; is what I initially thought.
Turns out no, it was stream issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see change in graphic quality during stutters.
So I doubt it&rsquo;s caused by the &ldquo;auto&rdquo; quality in the video player settings.
Which should result in video downgrade if the player decides to lower the quality
during the stutter.
I also don&rsquo;t see the stutters during archive playback.</p>
<p>Other than that stutters, Zaiko works great.</p>
<p>Some neutral stuffs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hovering cursor on seek bar in archive give visual preview, which is great.
Not every platform has this basic stuff.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no live chat replay in archive?
I don&rsquo;t really read the chat, but it sure feels weird looking at empty chats
during archive.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: superb, my first choice these days 🌟</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2024-12-28">Latest impression (2024-12-28)</h3>
<p>At this point, I believe troubles doesn&rsquo;t exist for Kamitsubaki x Z-an combination.
Smooth live, good video and audio quality, works on Firefox, and watch archive works!
(Even during ~8 hours long stream, it&rsquo;s relatively smooth)</p>
<p>I also tried from Firefox + Linux and Safari + iPadOS combination,
they&rsquo;re superb!</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-13">Previous impression (2023-09-13)</h3>
<p>Watched yet another big event, and there&rsquo;s a blackout mid stream.
No sound, no video.
They said the troubles only last 90s, but it felt like forever<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
With the live comments still running, I saw a lot of frustrated comments.
That makes me feel sad.
It was a theatrical type event and setting the mood was pretty important.
And the blackout ruined the mood buildup for me.</p>
<p>With all the recent troubles, I&rsquo;m starting to lose faith in Z-aN 🙁</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-03">Previous impression (2023-09-03)</h3>
<p>Still my favorite platform, everything from my first impression still applies
(assuming the site isn&rsquo;t down if they&rsquo;re hosting a big event with &gt;100k viewers).
And they even fixed the errors on Firefox.</p>
<p>On 2023-08-26, their site couldn&rsquo;t handle the load from Hololive Splash Party though<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
The live postponed live that day never happened.
It become a recording distributed on YouTube and the live ticket refunded.
I did not expect them to fail that bad.
Live viewers count should be under 200k from my estimates.</p>
<p>Also saw nginx error page from their site that day.
Weird feeling but I feel relaxed after realizing they also use some familiar tech in their stack.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated to the platform itself but I have to say this:
if you&rsquo;re even remotely interested with the idea of a virtual singer singing
cool songs in a future dystopian world, you need to watch <a href="https://www.zan-live.com/en/live/detail/10322">this live</a>.
It&rsquo;s AMAZING and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<p><del>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</del>
They fixed it as of 2023-08-27! Hooray 🥳</p>

<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
As these live streams ticket aren&rsquo;t exactly cheap,
I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one 🥲.</p>

Also works as a timecapsule letter, dear future me, don&amp;rsquo;t repeat these mistakes.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="monitors-used">Monitors Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dell U2417H [24&quot; 60Hz IPS Monitor]</li>
<li>ViewSonic XG2431 [24&quot; 240Hz IPS Monitor]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="macos--viewsonic-issues">MacOS + ViewSonic Issues</h2>
<p>Can&rsquo;t use random USB-C cable + USB hub for connecting ViewSonic to M1 MacBook Air running Big Sur.</p>
<p>Mac detected the monitor, but monitor show &ldquo;no signal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe cable or hub issue? Used the same exact cable and hub with different monitor, worked.</p>
<p>Maybe monitor port issue? Used same HDMI port with Windows desktop, worked.</p>
<p>Then I found this review on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/R19FF79H8JO7G9/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07JVKS8JQ">Amazon</a> for different ViewSonic model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other reviewers here have noted all the pros about this monitor, I will just add that 1-) the adjustable stand is especially easy to use and useful for long hours and avoiding neck pain and 2-) reminder that they ship only a display port/USB cable and an HDMI cable with it even though monitor is USB -C enabled. if you are running Mojave 10.14 or later the adapters for display port and HDMI simply will not work, the mac book will never see the monitor. You <em>must</em> get a USB-C 3.1 to C cable. Then you can just plug it all in. Also need to add a shout out to Anne at Amazon (complimentary) tech support for helping figure all this out by coordinating with ViewSonic because it wasn&rsquo;t documented anywhere at the point at which I was trying to do it. Thank you Anne!</p>

<p>Hey, that problem sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So I just learned there&rsquo;s a lot of USB-C variant, and USB-C 3.1 gen 2 is a thing.</p>
<p>Currently ordering a new cable, will update later.</p>
<p>Update: It&rsquo;s 2022 and I bought a new cable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ventioncable.com/product/usb-c-to-hdmi-cable-2/">HDMI to USB-C from Vention</a>.
Surprise! It worked! I&rsquo;ll skip the story of the package courier miss-deliver the cable and I had to buy it twice.</p>
<p>After using it a full day without problems, I realized a fatal miss when it&rsquo;s time to charge the laptop.
Macbook air only have 2 USB-C ports! 1 for monitor, and the other one for USB hub, this is for keyboard etc. and I can&rsquo;t work without it.</p>
<p>Okay, back to square one. I tried rummaging through my jumbled mess cable collection and found a HDMI to HDMI cable.
Not sure where it&rsquo;s from, maybe from Nintendo Switch.
It looks exactly like your average HDMI cable, and it&rsquo;s pretty old, but there&rsquo;s no harm in trying it right?</p>
<p>Another surprise! I have zero idea why, but connecting that old HDMI cable to the USB Hub and it worked! Mac could properly detect the monitor now.
The only thing I can identify from the cable is E202584 AWM from a company called Linkiss.</p>
<p>In a way, I wasted a total of IDR 319K for unused cables and few hours to look into the cause.
What I learnt from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no idea how HDMI works</li>
<li>I have even less idea how USB C works</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows--monitors-with-mixed-hdr-mode">Windows + Monitors with Mixed HDR Mode</h2>
<p>Windows 10 with multi-monitor, but only some of them have support HDR.</p>
<p>If HDR is enabled on supported monitors, this will break preview feature from Windows on non-HDR monitor. E.g. win+tab will show black desktop and windows, hovering on running program from taskbar will show black window instead of actual preview.</p>
<p>Solution, turn off HDR :(</p>
