<p>Rating: avoid if possible üëé</p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unuseable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>

<p>Last watched: 2023-06-21, variety show with Asaka as guest</p>
<p>Rating: decent but no choice on exclusive content üòê
(Firefox user: bad site üëé)</p>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Suprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a dealbreaker.</p>
<h3 id="niconico-dwango">Niconico (Dwango)</h3>

<p>Last watched: 2023-03-15, Nornis 1st live</p>
<p>Rating: paid for video, only got the audio üò≠</p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Pratically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subsribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>
<h3 id="spwn">SPWN</h3>
<p>Link: <a href="https://virtual.spwn.jp">https://virtual.spwn.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2022-03-20, hololive 3rd fes</p>
<p>Rating: pretty safe choice if available üëç</p>
<p>So far the most platform I&rsquo;ve been using and has the least problem with.
From time to time has bad connection to Indo
even after turning on low latency mode on their video player.</p>
<h3 id="youtube-member-only-live-kinda-counts">YouTube (member only live, kinda counts)</h3>
<p>Link: <a href="https://youtube.com">https://youtube.com</a></p>
<p>Last watched: pretty much every month</p>
<p>Rating: probably the live you want to watch is not here üòî</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s YouTube.
They probaby have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t run ticketing for one-time watch.</p>
<h3 id="z-an">Z-aN</h3>

<p>Rating: my new go to platform ü´∂
(Firefox user: Booo, please fix the video player ü§ï)</p>
<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<p>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</p>

            <p>On Firefox, after few mins the video player will error out, needing a page refresh</p>

            <p>Bonus: Z-aN wants me to enter my date of birth as a single-byte number, I have no idea how to convert a date into a single byte.</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
So I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one ü•≤.</p>

Also works as a timecapsule letter, dear future me, don&amp;rsquo;t repeat these mistakes.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="monitors-used">Monitors Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dell U2417H [24&quot; 60Hz IPS Monitor]</li>
<li>ViewSonic XG2431 [24&quot; 240Hz IPS Monitor]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="macos--viewsonic-issues">MacOS + ViewSonic Issues</h2>
<p>Can&rsquo;t use random USB-C cable + USB hub for connecting ViewSonic to M1 MacBook Air running Big Sur.</p>
<p>Mac detected the monitor, but monitor show &ldquo;no signal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe cable or hub issue? Used the same exact cable and hub with different monitor, worked.</p>
<p>Maybe monitor port issue? Used same HDMI port with Windows desktop, worked.</p>
<p>Then I found this review on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/R19FF79H8JO7G9/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07JVKS8JQ">Amazon</a> for different ViewSonic model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other reviewers here have noted all the pros about this monitor, I will just add that 1-) the adjustable stand is especially easy to use and useful for long hours and avoiding neck pain and 2-) reminder that they ship only a display port/USB cable and an HDMI cable with it even though monitor is USB -C enabled. if you are running Mojave 10.14 or later the adapters for display port and HDMI simply will not work, the mac book will never see the monitor. You <em>must</em> get a USB-C 3.1 to C cable. Then you can just plug it all in. Also need to add a shout out to Anne at Amazon (complimentary) tech support for helping figure all this out by coordinating with ViewSonic because it wasn&rsquo;t documented anywhere at the point at which I was trying to do it. Thank you Anne!</p>

<p>Hey, that problem sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So I just learned there&rsquo;s a lot of USB-C variant, and USB-C 3.1 gen 2 is a thing.</p>
<p>Currently ordering a new cable, will update later.</p>
<p>Update: It&rsquo;s 2022 and I bought a new cable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ventioncable.com/product/usb-c-to-hdmi-cable-2/">HDMI to USB-C from Vention</a>.
Surprise! It worked! I&rsquo;ll skip the story of the package courier miss-deliver the cable and I had to buy it twice.</p>
<p>After using it a full day without problems, I realized a fatal miss when it&rsquo;s time to charge the laptop.
Macbook air only have 2 USB-C ports! 1 for monitor, and the other one for USB hub, this is for keyboard etc. and I can&rsquo;t work without it.</p>
<p>Okay, back to square one. I tried rummaging through my jumbled mess cable collection and found a HDMI to HDMI cable.
Not sure where it&rsquo;s from, maybe from Nintendo Switch.
It looks exactly like your average HDMI cable, and it&rsquo;s pretty old, but there&rsquo;s no harm in trying it right?</p>
<p>Another surprise! I have zero idea why, but connecting that old HDMI cable to the USB Hub and it worked! Mac could properly detect the monitor now.
The only thing I can identify from the cable is E202584 AWM from a company called Linkiss.</p>
<p>In a way, I wasted a total of IDR 319K for unused cables and few hours to look into the cause.
What I learnt from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have no idea how HDMI works</li>
<li>I have even less idea how USB C works</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows--monitors-with-mixed-hdr-mode">Windows + Monitors with Mixed HDR Mode</h2>
<p>Windows 10 with multi-monitor, but only some of them have support HDR.</p>
<p>If HDR is enabled on supported monitors, this will break preview feature from Windows on non-HDR monitor. E.g. win+tab will show black desktop and windows, hovering on running program from taskbar will show black window instead of actual preview.</p>
<p>Solution, turn off HDR :(</p>
