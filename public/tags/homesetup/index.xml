<p>Initially I planned to buy an UPS way earlier, but keep holding off from buying for various reasons.
It&rsquo;ll be hard to move places if I have UPS.
It probably won&rsquo;t solve my badly grounded wirings in my place.
What about compatibility with PFC active PSU?
Macbook chargers?
Oh no, the vendor recommends using cable under 2m from the socket to UPS for best operation.
I don&rsquo;t have that kind of close-to-floor sockets in my place.</p>
<p>Ah, fuck it. I&rsquo;m tired having my PC crashing down whenever there&rsquo;s power outage in my area.
That&rsquo;s what I thought last week.</p>
<p>I quickly search around and try to find which brand has decent quality and support in my country.
APC it is.
I still need to buy a watt-meter though to figure out which model buy.
Definitely buying a line interactive one though<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;m done measuring all my equipment watt usage, I decided to buy this guy, <a href="https://www.apc.com/ph/en/product/BVX1200LI-MS/apc-easy-ups-bvx-1200va-230v-avr-universal-sockets/">APC BVX1200LI-MS</a>.
Rated for 1200VA and max 650W.</p>
<p>Today, this bad boy arrived. So I&rsquo;m going to leave it to charge overnight and test it tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Test run done, work just fine under normal load so far.
It also free up 2 slot from my usual power strip, which is great!</p>

Raspbian model 2 to work.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I bought my first Raspberry Pi at 2015, it was model 2.
I was an idealist and foolish college freshman at the time.
Things happened, and fast forward 7 years later, my Pi was collecting dust.
And here I am thinking want I want to do over the new year break.
So, as a QoL improvement to my home network, it might be nice to have a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the SD card is still alive and it&rsquo;s still running 2018&rsquo;s version Raspbian.
Hardware also looks good, so I proceed to nuke the SD card and install the latest OS.
Seems like Raspbian is no longer a thing, they have Raspberry Pi OS now<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t even take 3 hours to get everything running and working.
I expected it to take a lot more time as I&rsquo;m setting this up while having lunch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry OS download and write to SD (30 mins)
<ul>
<li>They have official imaging utility now, downloading the image and writing it to the SD card is a breeze now<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>My internet speed sucks though, so the download still take some time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setup static IP for the Pi (needed for Pi-hole) (10 mins)
<ul>
<li>I hate the built-in interface of the ISP provided router with passion (it&rsquo;s Huawei from IndiHome BTW).
It is sluggish and hard to navigate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install and set-up Pi-hole on the Pi (20 mins)
<ul>
<li>Pi-hole has install script, and that really helps saving some time<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
Yes, running unknown script from the internet is dangerous, I understand the risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finding admin account for my ISP provided router (10 mins)
<ul>
<li>I just realized the admin user that I use cannot be used to change the DNS server settings.
Google here I go.
Thankfully I found an user I can use real quick, it&rsquo;s <code>telecomadmin</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change default DNS server to Pi-hole in the home router (5 mins)</li>
<li>Test everything is working (60 mins and counting)</li>
</ul>
<p>So far it&rsquo;s working great!</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m feeling happy when looking at the queries blocked number going up.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I still need to figure out some things though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why some query didn&rsquo;t go through Pi-hole?</li>
<li>How do I back up the SD card? The 7 y.o. SD card won&rsquo;t last forever.</li>
<li>Can I lower the Raspbian temperature? Making it sit in on top of a running router does not help at all.</li>
<li>Do I need to set up HTTPS for the console?</li>
<li>Should I set up my VPN to use Pi-hole as the DNS server? I&rsquo;m already using Tailscale for VPN and the Pi is connected to it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have an answer after running Pi-hole for a month or so. Tailscale also have official guide <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1114/pi-hole/">here</a>, so this should be a supported use case.</li>
<li>Should I set up <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/">unbound</a>?</li>
</ul>
