But graphs in Zwift isn&rsquo;t fancy enough.
I want ‚ú®fancy‚ú® graphs like in <a href="https://intervals.icu/">intervals.icu</a>.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been downloading FIT files from Zwift manually,
transfer them to my phone,
and use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/healthfit/id1202650514">HealthFit</a> to sync them to other places, including intervals.icu.</p>
<p>Here comes the main topic,
the workout in Zwift always show current power output.
But when I check the workout in intervals.icu, it says no power data ü§î.</p>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;s just FIT file from Zwift doesn&rsquo;t contain the power data when exported.
Turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.
When the exported FIT file is opened using <a href="https://www.fitfileviewer.com/">FIT File Viewer</a>, I can see the power data.
Same thing when the FIT file uploaded to intervals.icu directly, power is there.</p>
<p>So the issue was between HealthFit &lt;-&gt; intervals.icu.
I did a short internet search but couldn&rsquo;t find people with similar issues.
End up sending an email to HealthFit support about this.</p>
<p>The reply got is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From S. Lizeray</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Apple Health does not support cycling power, only running power. Hence it can‚Äôt be uploaded to the fitness platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s not a HealthFit issue, apparently it is an Apple Health limitation?</p>
<p>I did another search and found some lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.intervals.icu/t/healthfit-sync-for-activities-and-health-metrics/2718/35">From slizeray</a></p>
<p>HealthFit mirrors Apple Health and Apple Health is the only source of truth for HealthFit.</p>
<p>In addition, power data is not supported in Apple Health, so there is no power data in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, this confirms it!</p>
<p>I guess this means I would just stop using HealthFit and upload FIT files directly to intervals.icu if I want to see the power data ü•∫.</p>
<p>P.S. Shoutout to St√©phane Lizeray, I&rsquo;m not sure if this person is a one person army building HealthFit,
but thanks for HealthFit, fast support response, and all the informative replies in intervals.icu forum.</p>
<p>P.S.S. Dear Apple, I wish power data is supported in Apple Health üôè.</p>

They made my indoor cycling experience better with all the virtual tracks and online community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one thing that frustates me, pairing Apple Watch with Zwift for heart rate monitor.
Once in a blue moon, it just worked.
But most of the time, it is just pure frustration.</p>
<p>As someone who just want to pedal for distraction from work stress and workout,
fiddling and restarting things for 30 minutes before pedaling is just painful.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s not just me that had this issue, and it&rsquo;s been happening since forever.
Some threads I found in the Zwift support forum with
people trying to figure out some magic algorithm to pair it:</p>

<p>And after going all those threads, I finally found something more official in this <a href="https://forums.zwift.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-supported-operating-systems-december-2021/561496">December 2021 changes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, for Apple Watch owners: we are aware that this experience needs upgrades and we are working on a longer term vision for support. In the meantime, the Zwift Game and Companion apps will be removed from the Watch App Store.This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>New users will not be able to install the Zwift Game or Companion apps</li>
<li>Legacy users will be able to use the watch apps, but will receive no updates to either app</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, cool. At least at this point I know I can give up peacefully.
Apple Watch has never been the perfect device for workout partner.
The GPS acquisition time could take over 30 minutes.
The battery life isn&rsquo;t that great either with the sensors on workout mode.
And that&rsquo;s fine, because at the end of the day, Apple Watch is just a general purpose device
and it worked really well for that purpose.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m feeling conflicted, I&rsquo;m happy that I got my answers.
At the same time, I feel sad that I can&rsquo;t use what I already own and need to spent more money on dedicated device.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just browse for cheap and good HR monitor, and feel excited about my upcoming device instead.</p>
