that I start seeing various undocumented and bizarre errors.</p>
<p>At some point, I started collecting these errors as war trophies.
(Albeit most of the time, I lost the battle and just created new codespace
instead of fixing it.)</p>

<h2 id="whats-with-the-rarity">What&rsquo;s with the rarity?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to categorize the error by rarity.
Some of them are so rare and fleeting that I&rsquo;ve only saw them once in my life.</p>
<p>Rarities from the most common to the rarest:</p>
<ul>
<li>N - normal, encountered daily, nothing special.</li>
<li>R - rare, maybe once a week.</li>
<li>SR - super rare, ohh I&rsquo;ve seen this before months ago.</li>
<li>SSR - super super rare, hey have you seen this before - no what the heck is that!?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-with-the-title">What&rsquo;s with the title?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a parody on a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBQJfPBmRg">Guitar, Loneliness and Blue Planet</a> by kessoku band.
(It&rsquo;s good btw, you should check it out.)</p>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>
<ul>
<li>2024-06-25: add RPC and ECONNREFUSED error</li>
<li>2024-06-15: initial version</li>
</ul>

I finished up my lunch and returning to work.
I booted up my <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview">GitHub codespace</a> as usual.</p>
<p>I have a habit of running <code>git status</code> before doing anything.
Even though I know I have not done any changes yet.</p>
<p>This time it&rsquo;s different though.
Hmm, why there are diff?
And these are unfamiliar files.
There&rsquo;s also commented out code in the diffs.
Seems like a WIP code?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure codespace is a per user thing.
There&rsquo;s no built in feature to use other users codespace.</p>
<p>Anyway, I asked in the big engineering group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>me: Did someone use my codespace during lunch?</p>
<p>engineer 1: How did that happen!?</p>
<p>engineer 2: Hey, that&rsquo;s my code!</p>
<p>engineer 3: Ooh, somehow I got the same diff in mine.</p>
<p>(Wait what? There are others?)</p></blockquote>
<p>No one has ideas on the cause.
We end up opening a support ticket to GitHub.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear any replies yet from support.
So this mystery will stay unsolved for a while.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find similar issue being reported in the internet.
Maybe this is just a rare happening when different codespaces
mistakenly got allocated the same working directory? ðŸ¤”</p>
