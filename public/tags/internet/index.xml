<p>Last watched: 2023-03-18, hololive 4th fes</p>
<p>Rating: avoid if possible üëé</p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unuseable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>

<p>Last watched: 2023-06-21, variety show with Asaka as guest</p>
<p>Rating: decent but no choice on exclusive content üòê
(Firefox user: bad site üëé)</p>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Suprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a dealbreaker.</p>
<h3 id="niconico-dwango">Niconico (Dwango)</h3>
<p>Link: <a href="https://live.nicovideo.jp">https://live.nicovideo.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2023-03-15, Nornis 1st live</p>
<p>Rating: paid for video, only got the audio üò≠</p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Pratically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subsribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>
<h3 id="spwn">SPWN</h3>
<p>Link: <a href="https://virtual.spwn.jp">https://virtual.spwn.jp</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2022-03-20, hololive 3rd fes</p>
<p>Rating: pretty safe choice if available üëç</p>
<p>So far the most platform I&rsquo;ve been using and has the least problem with.
From time to time has bad connection to Indo
even after turning on low latency mode on their video player.</p>
<h3 id="youtube-member-only-live-kinda-counts">YouTube (member only live, kinda counts)</h3>
<p>Link: <a href="https://youtube.com">https://youtube.com</a></p>
<p>Last watched: pretty much every month</p>
<p>Rating: probably the live you want to watch is not here üòî</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s YouTube.
They probaby have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t run ticketing for one-time watch.</p>
<h3 id="z-an">Z-aN</h3>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.zan-live.com">https://www.zan-live.com</a></p>
<p>Last watched: 2023-06-17, Planet Station stage 8</p>
<p>Rating: my new go to platform ü´∂
(Firefox user: Booo, please fix the video player ü§ï)</p>
<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<p>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</p>

            <p>Bonus: Z-aN wants me to enter my date of birth as a single-byte number, I have no idea how to convert a date into a single byte.</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
So I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one ü•≤.</p>

Internet connection is already close being a public utility.
And here I am, having a hard time trying to find decent ISP that can provides service to my place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to change providers since at least 4 months ago.
And this effort will probably continue to 2023.</p>
<h2 id="provider-checklist">Provider Checklist</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at these things while looking for ISP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available at my place (duh)</li>
<li>Sane pricing, I&rsquo;m not going to pay for enterprise pricing</li>
<li>No scummy practice (ok, maybe at least minimal, none at all is unlikely to exists)</li>
<li>Use fiber connection or better</li>
<li>No weird quota or policy on rate limiting</li>
<li>Good uptime (it&rsquo;s 2022, please don&rsquo;t timeout when it&rsquo;s raining)</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are nice to have but not required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet only (no, I do not want to subscribe to your whatever TV/CCTV/streaming services)</li>
<li>Bring-my-own-modem or at least don&rsquo;t charge me with overpriced modem rent per month to the point I can buy the modem 4 times a year</li>
<li>IPv6 support (is this even a thing in Indonesia?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here I go, checking every single ISP that provides fiber connection and operates in Indonesia.
Like every single one of them, from &ldquo;every person know this name&rdquo; to &ldquo;is that an actual service name?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>*: indonet seems to only offer enterprise plan, I&rsquo;m not going to contact their sales for checking that.</p>
<p>**: MNC Play requires me to fill a form with personal identification etc. to check for coverage area.
I already did that with another ISP, got a lot of spam calls and no coverage, no thanks.</p>
<p>ISP availability last checked at: <code>2022-12-31</code></p>
<h2 id="2023-04-26---escape-from-jakarta">2023-04-26 - Escape from Jakarta</h2>
<p>I probably won&rsquo;t be updating this page anymore.
I&rsquo;m convinced I don&rsquo;t need to live in this city.
There&rsquo;s not much point in finding the ultimate ISP if every other aspects in life also sucks here for me.
Might as well try to move to a better place.</p>
<h2 id="2023-01-09---iconnet">2023-01-09 - Iconnet</h2>
<p>First time I heard about &ldquo;Iconnet&rdquo; from my coworkers. Apparently it&rsquo;s backed by Indo&rsquo;s PLN.
I checked their site, apparently my place is covered.
But, it&rsquo;s not great according to my source ü´†.</p>

         alt="Screenshot of Iconnet landing page showing empty testimony section taken on 2023-04-26."/> <figcaption>
            <p>What makes this ISP even funnier is that their own landing page have an empty testimony section.</p>
        </figcaption>

<h2 id="2022-12-31---first-media">2022-12-31 - First Media</h2>
<p>I already used First Media from the time they start showing up in my area (probably around ~2013).
At that time, they provide real fast connection.
But over the time, their price keeps climbing while the stability spirals downhill.
People I know have been saying this is because they keep adding more customers to existing terminals
regardless of the terminal capacity instead of adding more terminals üòï.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years later, after asking around, they still have the same issues.
Ignoring the ridiculous amount of spam from their marketing,
I hate the fact that their prices varies based on how much pressure you put into their customer support
or sales.
The more you complaint and want to cut their connection, the more discount you get ü§®.
Not being transparent with the pricing model is a bad enough sign for me to stay away.</p>
<h2 id="2022-11-27---oxygenid">2022-11-27 - Oxygen.id</h2>
<p>A promising ISP, if I could actually use it.</p>
<p>2022-10-01, late night: I applied via their online registration.</p>
<p>Same day, 9 p.m.: Contacted by their sales via WhatsApp, asking for location coordinates etc.</p>
<p>2022-10-03: Registration and payment completed, waiting for their technician now.</p>
<p>2022-10-04: Their technician came while it&rsquo;s raining heavily. Technician said all nearby terminals are full. Need to request validation team and see whether they can free up some unused terminal slots.</p>
<p>2022-10-10: Call from their sales, validation in progress.</p>
<p>2022-10-18: Another call from their sales, validation still in progress and might take even more time. They&rsquo;re asking to refund my money for now.</p>
<p>2022-11-27: I asked the same sales for updates on the validation. No reply.</p>
<p>Later on their sales did &ldquo;react&rdquo; to my messages though:
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/img/isp-oxygen-sales-react.jpg"
         alt="Oxygen.id sales reacted with tears of joy emoji to my inquiries"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Truly a üòÇ moment.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Now, I have no idea whether that person just quit from being a sales or it&rsquo;s their official response.
There&rsquo;s still some hope from this ISP if I tried to contact them again.
But not now, right now I don&rsquo;t have the patience to sit out months just for them to check whether they have available slots for me or not.</p>
<p>Bonus: I can&rsquo;t login to my customer account after changing the default password to a 25-characters password.
Pressing login does nothing, no message or UI feedback whatsoever.
I suspect my password is over the length limit they have for password üôÉ.</p>
