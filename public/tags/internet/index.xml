<p>🔖 Assumed post audience: someone who wants to watch concert/3D live online
but not sure which host to pick (if choices exists).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are non-exhaustive list of platforms that I&rsquo;ve watched on before.
I&rsquo;ve included my rough take on each platform and the dates.
Over the time these list might get outdated as the streaming platform keep updating their site.</p>
<h2 id="asobi-stage">ASOBI STAGE</h2>
<p>Note: ASOBI STAGE is different with ASOBI CHANNEL.
ASOBI CHANNEL is more like YouTube, free to watch platform,
and has different set of issues with ASOBI STAGE.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: totally worth it to watch Idolm@ster live in real time!</strong></p>
<p>The platform is pretty good, there are no major problems.
There are hiccups where video does not play but comments keep flowing,
but a refresh or two fixed it.
Also the light stick below the video player is a really nice touch.
And the fact you can control it with your phone is a proof they&rsquo;re putting
a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>Archive also works great, their viewing period is a bit short though,
around 2 weeks or so.</p>
<p>A slight annoyance: the comments section often stop scrolling midway during live,
scrolling manually to the bottom can fix it.
But often it also scrolls the main view instead of just the comment section.
Not sure if this is specific to my environment or not.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: avoid if possible 👎</strong></p>
<p>Okay-ish for watching the live stream.
Unusable for watching the archives.
Getting a bunch of audio issues on the archives like noises and out of sync,
after a while, no audio plays.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: service has been discontinued, nothing new here 🤷</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression">Latest impression</h3>
<p>No issue from the streaming side.
But the way they handle the end of service wasn&rsquo;t great.
There&rsquo;s only 2-3 months gap between <a href="https://hololive-fc.com/articles/news/arxj4MUHg3YRL5gyBny6NPWU">the announcement</a> (2023-11-30) and the closure (2024-01).
And no partial refunds for those paying annual subscriptions.
Sure now they&rsquo;re hosting all the contents for free now,
but there&rsquo;s no way these archives will be hosted online forever.</p>
<p>Now hololive is hosting their exclusive content on YouTube membership instead.</p>
<p>(Also their announcement page doesn&rsquo;t load when opened from Internet Archive.
Which means their website kinda sucks according to my personal standards.)</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-06-18">Previous impression (2023-06-18)</h3>
<p>A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022.
Surprisingly decent considering it&rsquo;s their own platform
and doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango
in the footer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Their website feels weird though with all commenters&rsquo; name feels
generated
(2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like).
And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.</p>
<p>Also, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
Which is a sad thing, but not a deal breaker.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict: video stream quality sucks, archive not included 😭</strong></p>
<p>Same old nico nico douga but with different name.
Functionally, it&rsquo;s great.
Practically, I can&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Last time I watched Nornis&rsquo; live, it&rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality.
I don&rsquo;t know if what&rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never
been good regardless of ISP.
Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subscribe to their
premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).</p>

<h3 id="latest-impression-2022-ish">Latest impression (2022-ish)</h3>
<p>So far the most platform I&rsquo;ve been using and has the least problem with.

<li>2024-05-04, Hanabasami Kyo 4th one-man live &ldquo;FLORIST&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict: works great except for the occasional stutters</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2024-05-05">Latest impression (2024-05-05)</h3>
<p>Honestly I forgot about this site until I tried to buy a new ticket this year.
Then I realized I have an account already in my password manager.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember anything noteworthy from the first impression.
Which is a good sign, no major issue back then.</p>
<p>But during the FLORIST live, there are stutters.
And it&rsquo;s the type where the stream repeats the stuttered part.
e.g. lyrics: one two three, stream: one two two three.
&ldquo;Hmm, is it a remix? I don&rsquo;t remember this part&rdquo; is what I initially thought.
Turns out no, it was stream issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see change in graphic quality during stutters.
So I doubt it&rsquo;s caused by the &ldquo;auto&rdquo; quality in the video player settings.
Which should result in video downgrade if the player decides to lower the quality
during the stutter.
I also don&rsquo;t see the stutters during archive playback.</p>
<p>Other than that stutters, Zaiko works great.</p>
<p>Some neutral stuffs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hovering cursor on seek bar in archive give visual preview, which is great.
Not every platform has this basic stuff.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no live chat replay in archive?
I don&rsquo;t really read the chat, but it sure feels weird looking at empty chats
during archive.</li>

<p><strong>Verdict: superb, my first choice these days 🌟 (assuming it&rsquo;s not hololive event)</strong></p>
<h3 id="latest-impression-2024-12-28">Latest impression (2024-12-28)</h3>
<p>At this point, I believe troubles doesn&rsquo;t exist for Kamitsubaki x Z-an combination.
Smooth live, good video and audio quality, works on Firefox, and watch archive works!
(Even during ~8 hours long stream, it&rsquo;s relatively smooth)</p>
<p>I also tried from Firefox + Linux and Safari + iPadOS combination,
they&rsquo;re superb!</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-13">Previous impression (2023-09-13)</h3>
<p>Watched yet another big event, and there&rsquo;s a blackout mid stream.
No sound, no video.
They said the troubles only last 90s, but it felt like forever<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
With the live comments still running, I saw a lot of frustrated comments.
That makes me feel sad.
It was a theatrical type event and setting the mood was pretty important.
And the blackout ruined the mood buildup for me.</p>
<p>With all the recent troubles, I&rsquo;m starting to lose faith in Z-aN 🙁</p>
<h3 id="previous-impression-2023-09-03">Previous impression (2023-09-03)</h3>
<p>Still my favorite platform, everything from my first impression still applies
(assuming the site isn&rsquo;t down if they&rsquo;re hosting a big event with &gt;100k viewers).
And they even fixed the errors on Firefox.</p>
<p>On 2023-08-26, their site couldn&rsquo;t handle the load from Hololive Splash Party though<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
The live postponed live that day never happened.
It become a recording distributed on YouTube and the live ticket refunded.
I did not expect them to fail that bad.
Live viewers count should be under 200k from my estimates.</p>
<p>Also saw nginx error page from their site that day.
Weird feeling but I feel relaxed after realizing they also use some familiar tech in their stack.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated to the platform itself but I have to say this:
if you&rsquo;re even remotely interested with the idea of a virtual singer singing
cool songs in a future dystopian world, you need to watch <a href="https://www.zan-live.com/en/live/detail/10322">this live</a>.
It&rsquo;s AMAZING and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p>First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform!
Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes.
From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection,
archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.</p>
<h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3>
<p><del>My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox.
Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers.</del>
They fixed it as of 2023-08-27! Hooray 🥳</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-write-this">Why did you write this?</h2>
<p>Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there.
As these live streams ticket aren&rsquo;t exactly cheap,
I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible.
Most of the time there&rsquo;s no choices though.
Even when there are choices, at most it&rsquo;s 2, it&rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one 🥲.</p>

Internet connection is already close being a public utility.
And here I am, having a hard time trying to find decent ISP that can provides service to my place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to change providers since at least 4 months ago.
And this effort will probably continue to 2023.</p>
<h2 id="provider-checklist">Provider Checklist</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at these things while looking for ISP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available at my place (duh)</li>
<li>Sane pricing, I&rsquo;m not going to pay for enterprise pricing</li>
<li>No scummy practice (ok, maybe at least minimal, none at all is unlikely to exists)</li>
<li>Use fiber connection or better</li>
<li>No weird quota or policy on rate limiting</li>
<li>Good uptime (it&rsquo;s 2022, please don&rsquo;t timeout when it&rsquo;s raining)</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are nice to have but not required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet only (no, I do not want to subscribe to your whatever TV/CCTV/streaming services)</li>
<li>Bring-my-own-modem or at least don&rsquo;t charge me with overpriced modem rent per month to the point I can buy the modem 4 times a year</li>
<li>IPv6 support (is this even a thing in Indonesia?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here I go, checking every single ISP that provides fiber connection and operates in Indonesia.
Like every single one of them, from &ldquo;every person know this name&rdquo; to &ldquo;is that an actual service name?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>*: Not going to bother with ISP targeting enterprise user.</p>
<p>**: MNC Play requires me to fill a form with personal identification etc. to check for coverage area.
I already did that with another ISP, got a lot of spam calls and no coverage, no thanks.</p>
<p>ISP availability last checked at: <code>2022-12-31</code></p>
<h2 id="2023-04-26---escape-from-jakarta">2023-04-26 - Escape from Jakarta</h2>
<p>I probably won&rsquo;t be updating this page anymore.
I&rsquo;m convinced I don&rsquo;t need to live in this city.
There&rsquo;s not much point in finding the ultimate ISP if every other aspects in life also sucks here for me.
Might as well try to move to a better place.</p>
<h2 id="2023-01-09---iconnet">2023-01-09 - Iconnet</h2>
<p>First time I heard about &ldquo;Iconnet&rdquo; from my coworkers. Apparently it&rsquo;s backed by Indo&rsquo;s PLN.
I checked their site, apparently my place is covered.
But, it&rsquo;s not great according to my source 🫠.</p>

        <p>What makes this ISP even funnier is that their own landing page have an empty testimony section.</p>

<h2 id="2022-12-31---first-media">2022-12-31 - First Media</h2>
<p>I already used First Media from the time they start showing up in my area (probably around ~2013).
At that time, they provide real fast connection.
But over the time, their price keeps climbing while the stability spirals downhill.
People I know have been saying this is because they keep adding more customers to existing terminals
regardless of the terminal capacity instead of adding more terminals 😕.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years later, after asking around, they still have the same issues.
Ignoring the ridiculous amount of spam from their marketing,
I hate the fact that their prices varies based on how much pressure you put into their customer support
or sales.
The more you complaint and want to cut their connection, the more discount you get 🤨.
Not being transparent with the pricing model is a bad enough sign for me to stay away.</p>
<h2 id="2022-11-27---oxygenid">2022-11-27 - Oxygen.id</h2>
<p>A promising ISP, if I could actually use it.</p>
<p>2022-10-01, late night: I applied via their online registration.</p>
<p>Same day, 9 p.m.: Contacted by their sales via WhatsApp, asking for location coordinates etc.</p>
<p>2022-10-03: Registration and payment completed, waiting for their technician now.</p>
<p>2022-10-04: Their technician came while it&rsquo;s raining heavily. Technician said all nearby terminals are full. Need to request validation team and see whether they can free up some unused terminal slots.</p>
<p>2022-10-10: Call from their sales, validation in progress.</p>
<p>2022-10-18: Another call from their sales, validation still in progress and might take even more time. They&rsquo;re asking to refund my money for now.</p>
<p>2022-11-27: I asked the same sales for updates on the validation. No reply.</p>
<p>Later on their sales did &ldquo;react&rdquo; to my messages though:

      alt="Oxygen.id sales reacted with tears of joy emoji to my inquiries"><figcaption>
        
        
        
        <p>Truly a 😂 moment.</p>
      </figcaption>
  
  </figure></p>
<p>Now, I have no idea whether that person just quit from being a sales or it&rsquo;s their official response.
There&rsquo;s still some hope from this ISP if I tried to contact them again.
But not now, right now I don&rsquo;t have the patience to sit out months just for them to check whether they have available slots for me or not.</p>
<p>Bonus: I can&rsquo;t login to my customer account after changing the default password to a 25-characters password.
Pressing login does nothing, no message or UI feedback whatsoever.
I suspect my password is over the length limit they have for password 🙃.</p>
