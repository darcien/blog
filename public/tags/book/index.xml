I have no idea how to buy English translated light novel(LN) and have it delivered to Indo.
Even if I knew, probably will be too expensive for me.</p>
<p>Book stores like Kinokuniya probably sell popular raw/untranslated LNs,
but I can&rsquo;t read those without opening a dictionary side by side.
So I end up reading a lot of &ldquo;free&rdquo; fan translated on online site like <a href="https://www.baka-tsuki.org">Baka-Tsuki</a>.</p>
<p>Then on March 20th 2013, Shining Rose Media(Shiromedia) published their first LN<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Penguin Summer&rdquo; by Mutsuzuka Akira, translated to Bahasa Indonesia.
It costs like IDR 50000, I can buy it with few weeks worth of pocket money!</p>

<p>I thought this is going to be the great age of LN in Indo.
Every LN I have read for free will be properly localized then I can pay for it.
Turn out I was wrong.</p>
<p>On 2017, Shiromedia released &ldquo;Absolute Duo Vol.2&rdquo; by Hiiragiboshi Takumi<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
Ever since then, there has been no updates on their social media.
That means no new LN from Shiromedia in the last 6 years ðŸ¥².</p>
<p>My only salvation is that I&rsquo;ve succeeded in buying every single LN published by Shiromedia for collection.</p>

<p>With the decline of physical book markets to the point bookstores are closing,
I doubt LN production will ever make a comeback in Indo.
Looking at these books now makes me feel really nostalgic.
I probably will try to keep these books as long as possible for collection.</p>
<h2 id="omake-1---nanana">Omake 1 - Nanana</h2>
<p>Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin a.k.a Ryuugajou Nanana&rsquo;s Buried Treasure by Ootorino Kazuma
is probably my favourite series out of all LNs published by Shiromedia.</p>

I got a recommendation for a survival handbook from my friend.</p>

<p>Finally finished reading it today, my first non-fiction book after a while.
I don&rsquo;t know how useful it would be, but I love this kind of book.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite highlights from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the situation, whether you&rsquo;re out in the mountains, on board a plane,
or driving cross-country, to &ldquo;survive&rdquo; means &ldquo;to outlive, to remain alive or in existence;
live on. To continue to exist or live after.&rdquo;
After all, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s really all aboutâ€”about continuing to exist,
no matter how dire the circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You have to be preparedâ€”mentally, physijcally, and equipment-wise.</li>
<li>You must not ignore the importance of the mental aspects of survivalâ€”in particular,
stay calm and do not panic.</li>
<li>You must have a survival plan that considers the following essential elements:
food, fire, water, and shelter (as well as signals and first aid).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And you just never know when things might take a turn for the worse.
Or the worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, the first key to surviving any worst-case scenario is simply this:</p>
<p>Do Not Panic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Destroy your passport (unless youâ€™re French).
A passport will allow pirates to quickly identify you and demand ransom from
family members; Americans, Brits, and citizens of other wealthy Western nations
make appealing targets. Pirates are less likely to kidnap French citizens,
due to the French governmentâ€™s steadfast refusal to negotiateâ€”and recent
deadly counterattacks by the French military. If you speak French, use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>High-risk search teams keep the following phrase in mind at all times:
<em>Look for the presence of the unusual or the absence of the usual</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Admit your own fallibility, even if the gaslighter will not.</strong></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all occasionally name-callers, or hypocrites, or incorrect
in our beliefsâ€”I am simply able to acknowledge to that.
You seem unable to do so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agree to disagree.</strong></p>
<p>You will never win an argument with a gaslighterâ€”just stay true to your own
values and beliefs, and let the conflict subside.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do not immediately assume that a clown is dangerous.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the clown on the street in broad daylight?</p>
<p>Likelihood: <strong>SAFE</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the clown hiding in the woods, bushes, or a sewer drain?</p>
<p>Likelihood: <strong>DANGEROUS</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sun rises in the east and sets in the westâ€”even in Australia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though seemingly impossible, begin to limit your time online.
Start with five hours online a day,
and slowly reduce time online by one hour a day for four days.
Consider learning a new skill (cooking, painting, surgery)
to fill your newly free time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The longer the water boils, the more microorganisms that are killed.
Beyond 10 minutes, however, no further purification occurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed their mix of useful trivia, I-probably-will-never-use-this information,
examples and illustrations. And the sprinkled jokes here and there is the icing
on the cake.</p>
<p>Reading the experts and sources also amaze me on all these peoples doing
things that are extraordinary from my point of view.</p>
<p>Some new things I learnt from the experts section:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tauromaquia">tauromaquia</a>: bullfighting.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_derby">demolition derby</a>: last man standing brawl with cars.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ambigamy/201709/psycho-proctologist-speaks-what-makes-ass-ass">psycho-proctologist</a>: someone who tries to define the
definition of assholes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking forward reading more book like this!</p>
