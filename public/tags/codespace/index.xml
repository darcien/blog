I finished up my lunch and returning to work.
I booted up my <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview">GitHub codespace</a> as usual.</p>
<p>I have a habit of running <code>git status</code> before doing anything.
Even though I know I have not done any changes yet.</p>
<p>This time it&rsquo;s different though.
Hmm, why there are diff?
And these are unfamiliar files.
There&rsquo;s also commented out code in the diffs.
Seems like a WIP code?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure codespace is a per user thing.
There&rsquo;s no built in feature to use other users codespace.</p>
<p>Anyway, I asked in the big engineering group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>me: Did someone use my codespace during lunch?</p>
<p>engineer 1: How did that happen!?</p>
<p>engineer 2: Hey, that&rsquo;s my code!</p>
<p>engineer 3: Ooh, somehow I got the same diff in mine.</p>
<p>(Wait what? There are others?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one has ideas on the cause.
We end up opening a support ticket to GitHub.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear any replies yet from support.
So this mystery will stay unsolved for a while.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find similar issue being reported in the internet.
Maybe this is just a rare happening when different codespaces
mistakenly got allocated the same working directory? ðŸ¤”</p>
