They made my indoor cycling experience better with all the virtual tracks and online community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one thing that frustates me, pairing Apple Watch with Zwift for heart rate monitor.
Once in a blue moon, it just worked.
But most of the time, it is just pure frustration.</p>
<p>As someone who just want to pedal for distraction from work stress and workout,
fiddling and restarting things for 30 minutes before pedaling is just painful.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s not just me that had this issue, and it&rsquo;s been happening since forever.
Some threads I found in the Zwift support forum with
people trying to figure out some magic algorithm to pair it:</p>

<p>And after going all those threads, I finally found something more official in this <a href="https://forums.zwift.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-supported-operating-systems-december-2021/561496">December 2021 changes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, for Apple Watch owners: we are aware that this experience needs upgrades and we are working on a longer term vision for support. In the meantime, the Zwift Game and Companion apps will be removed from the Watch App Store.This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>New users will not be able to install the Zwift Game or Companion apps</li>
<li>Legacy users will be able to use the watch apps, but will receive no updates to either app</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Okay, cool. At least at this point I know I can give up peacefully.
Apple Watch has never been the perfect device for workout partner.
The GPS acquisition time could take over 30 minutes.
The battery life isn&rsquo;t that great either with the sensors on workout mode.
And that&rsquo;s fine, because at the end of the day, Apple Watch is just a general purpose device
and it worked really well for that purpose.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m feeling conflicted, I&rsquo;m happy that I got my answers.
At the same time, I feel sad that I can&rsquo;t use what I already own and need to spent more money on dedicated device.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just browse for cheap and good HR monitor, and feel excited about my upcoming device instead.</p>

Actually, I will do it. Finally, I did it!</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some times, I just need to do it.
I feel like, if I were to do planning, and do it later when I have &ldquo;free time&rdquo;, it will never happen.</p>
<p>2 days ago, my coworker said &ldquo;Aww, Discord doesn&rsquo;t have built in command for random number picker :(&rdquo;.
I jokingly replied &ldquo;I can build that&rdquo;.
Probably nobody expected me to actually build it.
Not even me at the time.</p>
<p>Later on, I continue working as usual, but it was a bad day.
I keep getting the same red error screen of death until the end of work day.
Feeling defeated, I don&rsquo;t want to end my day like this.</p>
<p>Then I remembered the earlier random number picker conversation.
I will build that, it should be a good refresher.
I have no good reason why I decided so.
There are probably Discord apps that provide it already.
There are probably countless of website that could do that for you with extra browser clicks.</p>
<p>Fast forward few hours later.
I did it!</p>

  <script defer type="text/javascript">
    window.addEventListener("load", function() {
      Lightense('img:not(.no-lightense, [aria-label="logo"])', {
        
        
        
        background: 'rgb(155, 156, 157 / 60%)',
      });
    }, false);
  </script>
<p>It probably took around 5 hours.
Mostly spent on reading Discord documentation on how to do it.</p>
<p>I put the code over <a href="https://github.com/darcien/bernard-bot">here</a>.
Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t have tests.
Yes, it&rsquo;s a bit messy.
But hey, I&rsquo;m still proud of it.
My previous post is all about me not being able to focus on doing 1 thing.
And the fact that I could focus long enough to finish is a good thing!</p>
