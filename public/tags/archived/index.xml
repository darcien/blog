The year is the approximate year I obtained them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2 id="functional">Functional</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple iPhone X 256GB [Handphone] (late 2018) -&gt; my daily driver, perfect fit for my hand.</li>
<li>Apple Watch Series 3 42mm [Smartwatch] (early 2021) -&gt; heartbeat and general physical activity tracker, at least it&rsquo;s cheaper than Garmin&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>Audio Technica ATH-M50x [Headphone] (~2016) -&gt; best general use headphone IMO.</li>
<li>Dell U2417H [24&quot; IPS Monitor] (mid 2018) -&gt; I love this monitor, might buy another one if my old monitor dies.</li>
<li>Endgame Gear XM1r [Wired Mouse] (early 2022) -&gt; I don&rsquo;t know why this is marketed as gaming mouse, but this is my perfect casual mouse and it has just right weight.</li>
<li>HP W2072a [20&quot; TN Monitor] (~2012) -&gt; one of my earliest monitor, still going strong!</li>
<li>ViewSonic XG2431 [24&quot; 240Hz IPS Monitor] (late 2021) -&gt; impulsive purchase, first time looking at monitor with high refresh rate, recommended by a friend.</li>
<li>KBParadise V80 Vintage MX Brown switch [Keyboard] (late 2018) -&gt; I won&rsquo;t go back to full sized keyboard.</li>
<li>Lenovo B40-70 [Laptop] (mid 2015) -&gt; from my uni, avoid this thing if possible, the frame is weaker than a rice cracker.</li>
<li>Logitech M325 [Wireless Mouse] (early 2014) -&gt; decent mouse with ridiculous lifetime.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Lite [Game Console] (mid 2019)* -&gt; why I can&rsquo;t dock it :&lt;</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch v2 [Game Console] (late 2020) -&gt; it can docks :D</li>
<li>ORICO SHC-U3 4 Port [USB Hub] (mid 2020) -&gt; some cheapo USB 3.0 hub, I need more ports.</li>
<li>Pioneer XDP-30R [Digital Audio Player] (early 2019) -&gt; awesome HQ audio player for the price, it also got mechanical volume dial, I love it!</li>
<li>Rock DT-618 [Wireless Charger] (late 2018) -&gt; kinda meh, slow charge and heats up after awhile.</li>
<li>Samson Meteor Mic [Condenser Microphone] (late 2017) -&gt; decent portable condenser mic, sadly it&rsquo;s USB only though.</li>
<li>Sony DualShock 4 v2 CUH-ZCT2 [Wireless Gamepad] (~2016) -&gt; you can&rsquo;t have a dead cable if you don&rsquo;t have any cables ;)</li>
<li>Sony SRS-XB10 [Wireless Speaker] (late 2018) -&gt; got it for free, pretty decent mono speaker.</li>
<li>Sony WH-1000XM3 [Wireless Headphone] (late 2018)* -&gt; pretty good noise cancelling, sadly not a good match with my ear shapes.</li>
<li>Yamaha AG06 [Audio Interface] (late 2020) -&gt; a godsent for managing all of my audio inputs, I also love its mechanical interface.</li>
</ul>
