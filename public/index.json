It was Bromo KOM X.\nPrep period Bromo KOM is a yearly event. In early January, my friend invited me to join Bromo KOM this year. Well, I said invited, but we still need to buy a ticket to participate. And there\u0026rsquo;s no sign of the ticket sale happening soon. That\u0026rsquo;s weird, usually they are on sale around this time of the year.\nAnyway, Bromo KOM isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a newbie friendly event. Previous year route was a ~95km ride with ~1900m elevation gain. I mean, we\u0026rsquo;re riding from the big city, all the way up to a mountain\u0026rsquo;s last checkpoint.\nSo I really need to all the training I can get. This is also my first time following a planned workout properly. I used JOIN Cycling planner, set up training plan for single event, and got a workout plan for the next few months.\nThis workout plan basically doubled the amount of time I spent on a bike. From 2-3h per week to 5-6h per week. It was pretty brutal in the early weeks. Then I got used to being tired everyday midway.\nThe ticket sale is finally announced in March. I stayed up at 3 a.m. to buy the ticket the moment it\u0026rsquo;s open. And I got it 🎉. Totally worth it, ticket was sold out in the noon. 1500 slot is a lot, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect the event was that popular.\nFast forward to a week before the event. Bromo KOM starting point is in Surabaya. That\u0026rsquo;s around 1.5h flight from my place. And this is going to be my first flight with my bike.\nI need a bike box to pack my bike and check it in for the flight. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any and have no plan to buy one anytime soon. Thankfully bike box rental is a thing. So I rented one for a week.\nMy bike packed in the Bonza hardcase bike box. My frame is 56 cm, the horizontal axis barely fits.\nThe bike box filled with my bike etc. weights around 24kg. It has wheels at the bottom, so moving it around wasn\u0026rsquo;t that hard.\nDay one, departure At the airport, I saw a lot of people lugging around their bike box. Hmm, these people are also Bromo KOM participants.\nIn the take off area, I can see even more bike box being loaded to a smaller plane. This is my first time seeing luggages being carried by a separate aircraft! I\u0026rsquo;m taking Garuda Airline which provides free sports equipment luggage up to 30kg. Which I guess can easily make a single plane overload if many people bring their bike.\nI went straight to the hotel after arriving in Surabaya. Surprise, the hotel is also full of cyclist. I can see a bunch of bike boxes stored in the receptionist area. There\u0026rsquo;s a man casually assembling their bike in the hotel lobby. People going up and down the lift with their bikes. It\u0026rsquo;s totally different than the hotel experience that I know of!\nAfter eating lunch, twice, we went to retrieve the race pack first. The race pack area is surprisingly organized. We got ours relatively quick. Then we registered for the optional return minivan. That\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m confident I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to pedal back from the finish line.\nCommemorative photo with the race pack. Later on we jokingly said the only thing special about Bromo KOM X is the race pack. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s just a pouch, but this year it\u0026rsquo;s an actual backpack.\nOnce that\u0026rsquo;s done we went to Decathlon. My friend forgot his rain coat and is worried about rain during the climb. Make sense, let\u0026rsquo;s buy a new one then. And then there\u0026rsquo;s me being a dumb ass. In the way, I realized I didn\u0026rsquo;t bring my water bottles\u0026hellip; So yes, I also had to buy new water bottles.\nTraffic wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly nice, so by the time we\u0026rsquo;re done shopping, it\u0026rsquo;s already dark. We\u0026rsquo;re back at the hotel at 7 p.m.-ish and we still need to assemble our bikes.\nMine and my friend\u0026rsquo;s bike box. It\u0026rsquo;s not very visible from the image, but my friend\u0026rsquo;s one is longer and is an easy-fit one, so no need to release the bike handlebar.\nOnce we\u0026rsquo;re done assembling, we\u0026rsquo;re super hungry. It\u0026rsquo;s time for dinner! I got katsudon for dinner to increase my chance of finishing tomorrow.\nAfter dinner, a nice bath, and a warm coffe, I slept like a baby.\nNot really, I need to wake up at 4 a.m.. And I\u0026rsquo;m too excited to sleep. That\u0026rsquo;s the end of the day one.\nDay two, the big day! At the end I got like 2.5h sleep. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel sleepy, I\u0026rsquo;m still excited! Not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s because of the event or because of my room neighbour alarm\u0026rsquo;s that has been ringing nonstop for 20 mins.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for breakfast. The hotel was nice enough to shift the morning breakfast to be before the event start. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s their way of saying thanks because most of their guests are cyclist at that day.\nAnd as expected, everyone is already wearing their gear for breakfast. Tight jersey, cycling shoes click-clacking on every steps, helmet that\u0026rsquo;s so out of place in a hotel breakfast area. Meanwhile I\u0026rsquo;m still in my pajama.\nAfter breakfast, I rushed to my room, change to my cycling gear, and then starts pedaling to the starting point. It\u0026rsquo;s around 3km from the hotel.\nIn the starting point, we had to scan the QR code there. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure for what, as the bib numbers attached to my back and the bike also had timing chip.\nIt was 5.30 a.m., I can hear the starting signal being sounded. Nice, this means the event started on time.\nFrom here, it\u0026rsquo;s 55 km to the pit stop in GOR Untung Suropati, Kota Pasuruan. This part is a relaxed group ride. No race until the KOM start. It took me 2 hours and 3 minutes to get there.\nBy the time I arrived, my saddle post is in the lowest position. I didn\u0026rsquo;t tighten the saddle post enough, so it\u0026rsquo;s slowly sinking during the ride. I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it until my friend pointed it out. Thankfully this is a big event, so we had bike mechanics on standby in the pit stop.\nWe got around 30 mins rest time in the pit stop.\nFrom pit stop to the KOM start, it\u0026rsquo;s around 15 km. We will depart according to our group, led by a road captain. Elite and 60+ group will depart first. Next is mine, under 29.\nIn this part, I tried to keep up with the leading pace. If I\u0026rsquo;m left behind, it will be hard to catch up with the peloton. This is a mistake, I should\u0026rsquo;ve kept my pace in Z2 or Z3. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a cyclocomp nor power meter for outdoor ride. So I pretty much burnt myself out right before the KOM start.\nKOM start at KM 70, and it\u0026rsquo;s a nonstop climb for 23.9 km, with average gradient of 6.9%. Thanks to my bad pacing, I\u0026rsquo;m already in recovery pace in the first climb.\nDuring recovery, I did my next mistake. One of my bottles is not closed properly. I tried to correct the bottle lid, but I dropped it. Then I spent the next few minutes trying to find it. I think it fell into the sewer, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it. Some worried cyclists saw me and asked if I\u0026rsquo;m okay. No worries, I\u0026rsquo;m good, just a little bit low on motivation. I gave up and starts pedaling again.\nAfter 1 hours of recovery pace, my heart rates has calmed down. And I\u0026rsquo;ve only covered 6 km.\nFrom this point on, it\u0026rsquo;s a loop of:\nhit the pedal until my HR enters Z4, rest at the side of the road until my HR is back to Z2, repeat. A photo I took during my rest. Yes it\u0026rsquo;s foggy, we\u0026rsquo;re up high in the mountain.\nIt was frustrating. Even if I pedal as slow as I can, my HR will still enter Z4. To think I was this weak.\nMidway, I started thinking about giving up. But I changed my mind. Remember the all the training you did. Remember the flight and hotel booking you paid. I already invested a lot of time and money here. Ain\u0026rsquo;t no way I\u0026rsquo;m giving up now.\nI kept pedaling. From this point, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember much details. I tried to stop thinking and just pedal. Embrace the pain.\nA photo taken by the event photographer. At this point, probably I\u0026rsquo;m in autopilot mode. No thoughts, just pedal.\nAround this part, I had to stop for medic twice. Both are for cramps on my left leg. That\u0026rsquo;s okay, I can still recover from this. Also around this time, I start seeing people going down with medals in their neck. That means I\u0026rsquo;m close to the finish line. I can do this.\nWell, not really. I still have 5 km to go. 5 km is nothing in a flat road. But here, that\u0026rsquo;s at least 1 hour of pedaling. And it\u0026rsquo;s already around 12 p.m.. I wonder if can still make it before the cut off time. Who is the idiot that said cut off time at 1 p.m. is easy? I regret saying that.\nAt 1 p.m., I finally reached the village area near the finish line. I can see the last climb. ~15% gradient, haha, it literally looks like a wall.\nFor the first few seconds, I can still pedal. I even said something like \u0026ldquo;You can do this, just a little bit more\u0026rdquo;, to the cyclist next to me. Then I started sprinting.\nI like the expression of the cyclist next to me in this photo.\nA photo depicting the face of suffering during the final climb.\nYou can see the fog is denser here, and the side view gives better perspective of the gradient.\nWell that sprint didn\u0026rsquo;t last long. That climb feels like a joke. Even walking and pushing my bike is hard.\nI took my last rest in the corner right before the finish line. Then I start sprinting again into the finish line. Welp, it\u0026rsquo;s past 1 p.m. already. I\u0026rsquo;ll content with just finishing.\nSurprise! I still got a medal. I thought maybe they are giving it to everyone. After I regrouped with my friend, he told me the cut off time is actually 1.30 p.m..\nWOW, okay then I finished before the cut off time? I\u0026rsquo;m so happy, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect that.\nCommemorative photo with the medal. Same bike since 6 years ago, but different person 🦵. (Also, my bottle with the missing lid is in clear view here\u0026hellip;)\n(Later on, based on the official result, I finished at 1:11:38 p.m.. It took me 4 hours 21 minutes and 50 seconds to finish the KOM climb. I was 3rd from the last in my age category 😂)\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;m done, I can finally relax. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of free food and drinks in the area.\nAfter that, me and my friend go downhill for 2 km to the pick up area. We\u0026rsquo;re going back to the city by minivan. There\u0026rsquo;s no way I\u0026rsquo;m going back by bike. I\u0026rsquo;m not strong enough for that right now. And I can see some super cyclist are going back by bike\u0026hellip;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s 5 of us in the minivan. The driver, me and my friend, and two other cyclists. One of them is a surgeon, and the other one is a retired person from Jayapura. We exchanged contacts, maybe we will do a Bromo KOM reunion in the future.\nThis event is an eye opener for me, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people from different background here. And all of them are coming here to suffer from the same climb.\nAfter 3 hours ride with the minivan, we\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at the city center. Hmm, the hotel is just 5 km away. Let\u0026rsquo;s go back by bike, my friend said. Yeah let\u0026rsquo;s do it, I replied.\nAnd so we did. It was the most annoying part of the day. The traffic, the pollution, the motorbikes, arghhhh. This is exactly why I hate outdoor ride in the city.\nThe rest of the day is pretty uneventful. We had dinner, took a shower, and sleep like a log.\nDay three, return trip Our last day in Surabaya. It\u0026rsquo;s a slow day, no recovery ride.\nWe had breakfast in the hotel. Disassembled our bikes, and pack it up. Then we go to the airport.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s another 1 hour flight.\nI can see Madura island and Suramadu bridge from the plane. (Yes the window is dirty, I can\u0026rsquo;t wipe it from my side.)\nAfter arriving in Soekarno-Hatta, we go straight to the oversize luggage area. And we waited for at least 30 minutes. At some point, the airport staff there asked, \u0026ldquo;Who else is waiting for the bike box? Raise your hands.\u0026rdquo;. Then almost everyone in the waiting area raised their hands. The staff stopped counting and just talked to walkie talkie, \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s at least 10 boxes, just get all of them out.\u0026rdquo;.\nNot long after that, I got my bike box. Then I took the taxi to my home. I arrived safely around 5 p.m., and that concludes my trip.\nHow much I spent on the trip? Description Amount (IDR) Registration fee 2,044,000 Flight (2-way) 3,290,000 Hotel (2 nights) 667,000 Bike box rental 500,000 Transport (w/o bike) 15,000 Transport (with bike) 596,000 Transport (minivan) 750,000 Water bottles (@2) 198,000 Food and drinks 350,000 Energy gel etc. 25,000 Souvenirs (it\u0026rsquo;s cake) 180,000 Photos (not free 🥲) 100,000 Total 8,715,000 Other tidbits I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where to put The elevation graph looks familiar. You can see the shape of the mountain from the graph.\nClosing thoughts It was not a cheap trip, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did it. One item crossed off my bucket list.\nLearning points for me:\nPacing need improvements. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to open bottle lid during the ride, especially a climb. You will lose it. Remembering why you started doing something is a good way to stop yourself from giving up. For long ride like this, you need energy gels, anti-chafe, and sunscreen. Athlete is called super human for a reason. I should\u0026rsquo;ve taken more photos. Also, special thanks for my friend, Yoan, for inviting me. As a casual cyclist, I probably won\u0026rsquo;t join this kind of event without being invited.\nPost 25 of #100DaysToOffload.\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/bromo-kom-x/","summary":"A story about my first big cycling event.","title":"Bromo KOM X"},{"content":"It was another normal day at work.

One of those commercial and cheap grounded coffee. I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay that much attention to the ingredients until later on. Turns out what I\u0026rsquo;ve been drinking are not 100% coffee! It contains a bunch of things I did not expect to be in a coffee, like corn starch.\nAt some point I started buying real grounded coffee from local shop. I thought I don\u0026rsquo;t care the coffee type as long as it can be brewed into black water. After years of trying different coffee, maybe I can actually tell the difference and have some preference?\nAnd because there are so many of coffee variations, I need a way to avoid the bad ones and keep tab on my favorites.\nAnd now, here we are with a list of coffee I\u0026rsquo;ve tried and barely remember the tastes.\nEvery grounded coffee I\u0026rsquo;ve ever bought (or barely remember) Brand/Shop Variant Taste Comment Excelso Arabica Gold 😐 - Excelso Brazilian Santos 😏 It has that unique burnt coffee taste Excelso Kalosi Toraja 😐 - Excelso Robusta Gold 😐 - Kopi Boutique Arabica Toraja Sulotco Sulawesi 😐 - Kopi Boutique Robusta Java Dampit 😐 - Macehat Arabica Sumatra Mandheling 🤔 Not a good latte material for me Northsider Aceh Gayo Wine 🤢 Well it kinda look like wine, but the taste, ugh I can\u0026rsquo;t bear it, sorry Northsider Arabica Flores Bajawa Fully-washed 😐 - Northsider Arabica Gunung Halu Banana Honey 😐 - Northsider Arabica Ijen Blue Mountain Honey 😐 - Northsider Arabica Java Malabar Red Honey 😐 - Northsider Arabica Toraja Bittuang Natural 😐 - Northsider Black Onyx blend (Robusta Java, Arabica West Java \u0026amp; Aceh) 😐 - Northsider Classic blend (Robusta Dampit, Arabica Flores) 😀 Starting tad bland, but feels strong later on, not bad! Northsider Cold White blend (Robusta Temanggung, Arabica West Java \u0026amp; Gayo) 😐 - Northsider North blend (All Arabica: Columbia, Brazil, Ethiopia) 😐 Feels weird at first, but it tastes just okay after a while. Northsider Razeta'55 blend (Arabica Brazil, Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) ❤️ I\u0026rsquo;ve been buying this blend for more than a year straight, probably my favorite blend so far. Northsider Sweet Gayo blend (Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) 😊 Just like the name suggests, it smells sweet. With milk, not so much, but I still like it. I can barely remember the taste for some of the coffee in the list, some are too acidic, some has that floral smell, but I lost those notes. So some of the taste and comments is kinda outdated until I bought them again for curiosity.\nHow did you make the coffee? It\u0026rsquo;s almost always pour over grounded coffee using paper filter. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using the same Hario V60 dripper for years.\nGood old manual coffee dripper.\nFor the coffee, I use around 16g coffee for 3 servings. Then grab whatever milk from the fridge, usually it\u0026rsquo;s plain but it could be some low-fat mochachino. Pour the milk to the mug first. Then pour the coffee, done!\nA warm coffee with milk, calms my mind 👌\n(Maybe one day I\u0026rsquo;ll upgrade my kit and include practicing making latte art 🤔)\nHow \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo; is the roasted beans? I\u0026rsquo;ve read/heard from people that using fresher roasted beans gives better coffee tastes. Honestly, I can\u0026rsquo;t tell the differences. As long as the coffee powder is still good, no mold etc., I have no complaints.\nFor example, these coffee from Northsider, I bought them at 24 October. And from the packaging, it says production date is 17 October. Assuming it\u0026rsquo;s the roasting date, hey it only took 7 days from coffee beans to ready to use coffee powder. Fresh and enough for me. Heck, it\u0026rsquo;s way fresher than the coffee being enjoyed by these cool people in Antarctica. One of their coffee is 3 years old!\nBack side of some Northsider\u0026rsquo;s coffee bags, it says production date: 2023-10-17, and best before: 2024-10. Taken at 2023-10-26.\nOther Photos?

Definitely not because my city has plummeted from bad to worst1.\nThis post will contain everything I did to set up AirGradient, all the way to storing and viewing historical data locally.\nWhat parts/components/tools are used? For air monitoring AirGradient DIY Pro, I bought 2 units, pre-soldered kit. My kit includes: Pro PCB version 4.2 ESP8266 WeMos D1 mini v4 microcontroller Senseair S8 CO2 sensor Plantower PMS5003 PM sensor Sensirion SGP41 VOC and NOx sensor Sensirion SHT40 temperature and humidity sensor SH1106 128x64 1.3\u0026quot; OLED display USB-C 2m cable plastic enclosure, screws, and (small) screwdriver Power supply, 5V 3A. This forum post mention they recommend 5V and at least 2.4A for WeMos D1 used in the pro kit. I could only find made-in-China power supplies here, it\u0026rsquo;s better than nothing. USB cable, 3m, USB-A to USB-C with right angle so it can fit behind the air monitor. The supplied 2m cable is not enough for me. 3M adhesive hooks and random knitting threads. Using plastic hooks + threads so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to put a hole in the wall to hang the air monitor. For storing and viewing sensor data TL;DR I\u0026rsquo;m using Home Assistant container on old MacBook for local server.\nAirGradient has their own home server to host the data sent from the sensor. I got free 2 year subscription for their server from buying their pro kit.\nThat means:\nI need 24/7 internet connection to send the data, and sending all sensor data to uncontrolled server 🙁. I don\u0026rsquo;t really like that idea, so I will need my own local server to handle the sensor data. And reflash the AirGradient microcontroller to send the data to my server instead.\nSearching the internet leads me to Home Assistant (HA) + ESPHome setup.\nMy options for hosting HA are:\nreuse Raspberry Pi 2 model B that already runs Pi-hole, use old 15\u0026quot; MacBook from 2015, use cheapo 14\u0026quot; Lenovo laptop from 2015 (it runs Arch btw), reuse cloud VM (small droplet in SG region that runs NixOS), buy ready-to-use Home Assistant server, buy new Raspberry Pi 4 I went through the possible HA installation methods to cross-check which host should I use for HA.\nPossible HA installation methods are:\nSupervised: this requires strict dependencies setup and maintaining them, no go. OS: this requires wiping the host OS or running VM inside the host, which requires non-trivial overhead for CPU consumption etc. Keen to avoid this. Core: oh it\u0026rsquo;s Python, sorry but I do not want to manage Python installation, no go. Container: this require a container environment and running a built HA image. Container installation is the most sane setup for me, so I\u0026rsquo;m going with it. (Later on I realized HA container cannot use HA add-ons. That means I cannot use ESPHome HA add-ons to make things easier. But that is fine, I could live without the add-ons.)\nGoing back to my hosting choices and by the process of elimination:\nRaspberry Pi 2 probably won\u0026rsquo;t be strong enough, HA recommends Pi 3 or 4. So, no go. (I saw some people tried running HA on Pi 2B, it\u0026rsquo;s kinda hit and miss.) Cloud VM probably will work, but requires internet connection. Keeping this as last resort. HA Yellow, I checked the price from the Chinese supplier, it\u0026rsquo;s going to cost 179 USD or more, not including shipping and tax. No thanks, that\u0026rsquo;s too expensive for me. New Raspberry Pi 4: The official supplier is either gone or out of stock here. And there\u0026rsquo;s only scalper with crazy price tag in local marketplace. No thanks. Old laptops, these are my best bets for now. At the end, I picked the MacBook over Lenovo since it has better CPU. It runs macOS 12 and the UI is a bit laggy, but it should be good enough since I\u0026rsquo;m only accessing it via SSH anyway.\nFor flashing the microcontroller I need to reflash the D1 mini to make it send data to my server. I have no idea how to do it though, reading ESPHome website feels overwhelming at first. After furiously reading the docs, FAQ, and a mug of coffee, I think I get it.\nWith ESPHome, you:\nwrite declarative config (in YAML) for the micrcontroller firmware instead of writing the code directly. use ESPHome CLI to compile the YAML config into a runnable firmware and upload it to the microcontroller. I will be using Docker on macOS to run ESPHome and according to this, I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to flash via USB cable. So I will need to use ESPHome\u0026rsquo;s web flasher.\nWhat work are done to start seeing numbers in dashboard? Assembling the AirGradient kit AirGradient has the full assembly instruction in their website. Mine is pretty straightforward since I bought the pre-soldered kit which involves sticking sensor to the correct places.\nPre-soldered AirGradient kit that comes with the display and PM sensor already attached.\nFully assembled kit, with everything sticked in.\nSanity checking the kit Power on the kit by connecting to power supply. Make sure everything is looks good, sensors and display are working. Better do this before screwing the enclosure tightly.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have other sensor for baseline of the installed sensors though. So I can\u0026rsquo;t sense check the sensor values.\nFlashing the microcontroller Connect the microcontroller directly to a computer with USB cable. Connecting the cable to the PCB will not work! Open up web flasher. In the flasher, press connect and pick the microcontroller and connect. On mine, it says \u0026ldquo;USB Serial (cu.usbserial-1120)\u0026rdquo;. Yours might be different. Press \u0026ldquo;PREPARE FOR FIRST USE\u0026rdquo;. Read the explanation first and install after understanding it. Wait for it to finish installing. After done installing, continue setting up Wi-Fi for the device in the flasher. This will allow us to flash over the network. If everything works fine, you should be able to access the web server hosted in the microcontoller by accessing the device IP directly. At this point we can start writing ESPHome config be flashed over the network. I would expect myself taking months to finish writing the config. Thankfully a nice person has shared their config in the internet, like this one. I end up using this config from @ex-nerd\u0026rsquo;s PR. Specifically this file that\u0026rsquo;s intended for AirGradient Pro version 4.2.\nSteps I did for compiling the firmware:\nCopy the AirGradient config YAML and secrets.yaml, save them in a new directory somewhere in the computer. Modify the config as needed, the instruction comments in there is pretty self explanatory. While editing the YAML, the editor IDE might complain about \u0026ldquo;Unresolved tag: !secret\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s fine to ignore those warnings. Those are HA config specifics that is also supported by ESPHome. Fill in the variables in the secrets.yaml. For the home_assistant_encryption_key, it needs to be base64 string. The docs page from ESPHome has a generator for it. ✅ Make sure to backup secrets.yaml, otherwise you will need to reflash if you lose access.\nRun ESPHome CLI to compile and upload the firmware to the microcontroller. I\u0026rsquo;m using Docker to run it, so mine looks like this: docker run --rm -v \u0026quot;${PWD}\u0026quot;:/config -it ghcr.io/esphome/esphome run air-gradient-pro-diy.yaml. In my case, the upload step failed because esphome unable to find my device. Error log:\n...

Some of sensor numbers might show up as N/A for a while. I haven\u0026rsquo;t debugged this, but after leaving it powered on for few mins, N/A got replaced with numbers. So the sensors might be just starting and simply haven\u0026rsquo;t picked up and sent any data yet.\nNow we have the sensors ready to send data, it\u0026rsquo;s time to setup the receiving part!\nSetting up Home Assistant container MacOS HA installation docs actually does not have container installation. Luckily prior to this, I already found this post from Ixion about setting up Home Assistant on macOS. I accidentally found that post when trying to find a way to run HA VM image using Lima, with the lima keyword accidentally matching on the colima used in the post.\nWhat I did to set up HA is exactly as described in Ixion\u0026rsquo;s post, summarized as:\nInstall Colima and Docker on macOS (using brew) Start Colima Configure Colima to use the host network Install Home Assistant on Docker Set up Home Assistant https://blog.illixion.com/2023/04/colima-home-assistant/\nWith some exceptions:\nWhen configuring Lima to use socket_vmnet, my path for socket_vmnet is different. I had to a bit of manual cd and ls ritual, and found mine on /usr/local/opt/socket_vmnet/bin/socket_vmnet instead of /opt/homebrew/bin/socket_vmnet. I just learned brew has subcommand for finding the path, brew info \u0026lt;formula\u0026gt;, e.g. brew info socket_vmnet and it will spit out the installation path. When opening the network settings in HA, mine is blank. Turns out I need to turn on \u0026ldquo;Advanced Mode\u0026rdquo; in my HA profile. After that, I can open the network settings and pick lima0 network adapter. Before realizing that, I thought the network settings is not accessible remotely. I tried accessing from localhost by port forwarding the dashboard, it didn\u0026rsquo;t help at all. Connecting AirGradient with Home Assistant According to this HA docs, HA should be able to automatically discover a running ESPHome device in the same network. I have not tried it. Instead I tried manually adding the ESPHome device or in this case the AirGradient to HA.\nFrom the HA dashboard, do:\nOpen \u0026ldquo;Settings \u0026gt; Devices \u0026amp; Services\u0026rdquo;, In \u0026ldquo;Integrations\u0026rdquo; tab, press \u0026ldquo;ADD INTEGRATION\u0026rdquo; in bottom right, Search and click \u0026ldquo;ESPHome\u0026rdquo; integration, Put the AirGradient IP in the host field, keep the default 6053 port, and submit. If HA can find and connect to AirGradient, it will ask for encryption key. Paste in the home_assistant_encryption_key configured in secrets.yaml that\u0026rsquo;s used for flashing the AirGradient. That\u0026rsquo;s all! I can see my AirGradient sensors in HA dashboard.\nMy HA dashboard after connecting one AirGradient kit.\nWhy I\u0026rsquo;m getting Can't connect to ESP. when connecting AirGradient to HA? Make sure AirGradient is discoverable from HA.\nIn my case, I was accessing HA dashboard via Tailscale Magic DNS. So my dashboard URL looks like: http://unicorn:8123. And when adding AirGradient, I keep getting Can't connect to ESP. error even with the correct IP. After using SSH tunnel to expose the dashboard as: http://localhost:8123, adding AirGradient worked!\nThe tunnel command looked something like this:\nssh -L 8123:localhost:8123 -N -T darcien@unicorn My HA container does not expose any address in colima list! Try doing colima restart, and restart the HA container. Also check the container log for more clue.\nRestarting HA container with colima restart failed!

The AirTest only have PM2.5 sensor, no idea what specific sensor is installed in it. It is sold at 1.990.000 IDR and have 30 days pre-order2, now that\u0026rsquo;s expensive for a single sensor with closed design.\nHow much electricity does this setup use? A power meter showing 0.945 KWh after 6 days 15 hours 10 minutes for the server (from empty battery).\n0.945 KWh = 6 days 15 hours 10 minutes\n0.945 KWh = 9550 minutes\n0.006 KWh = 60 minutes\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 0.006 KWh per hour, or 4.32 KWh per month. So I\u0026rsquo;m paying around 6.241 IDR per month using 1.444,7 IDR per KWh rate.\nI\u0026rsquo;m excluding the electricity usage from the sensors because they\u0026rsquo;re too low. Leaving the metered sensors a week gave me 0 KWh on the power meter.\nWhat is the gfonts:// in the ESPHome config? It\u0026rsquo;s a special ESPHome syntax for using Google Fonts in the display.\nHow long until the sensors needs to be replaced? I\u0026rsquo;m not too sure yet. I\u0026rsquo;m seeing some discussion about this in AirGradient forum, and AirGradient said they still have PMS5003 sensor working even after 4 years3. I sure hope Jakarta\u0026rsquo;s air is not polluted enough to the point I need to replace PM sensors often. At that point, sensor life expectancy is the least of my worries.\nBack up plans for HA container? As I just finished with setting up, I have no concrete plans yet. I looked a bit into the forum and found this thread which has various approaches. Standing up an automatic backup most likely won\u0026rsquo;t be a 5 minutes job, so I will need to revisit this later.\nHow accurate is the PM sensors used? i.e. PMS5003 I learnt from this post that PMS5003 is using approximation for PM2.5 and PM10, and is only accurate for PM1. Well fortunately, the in-depth explanation proves PMS5003 is good enough for urban environment that doesn\u0026rsquo;t change too much like my bedroom and livingroom!\nVarious photos AirGradient packaging and boxes AirGradient package that looks manually packaged by hand and sent from Thailand.\nTwo boxes of AirGradient Pro DIY kit.\nFirst look after opening the kit.\nAirGradient AirGradient in action.

Okay, the other part is because I saw the same thing on someone\u0026rsquo;s blog1, and thought it was pretty cool. Seems like that blog is also built with Hugo but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out what theme is being used.\nAfter few minutes and one DevTools later, their zoomable image is powered by Lightense. And after bruteforcing my way through GitHub code search, I found out the theme being used. It\u0026rsquo;s Menca, a paid theme by AnvodStudio.\nAww shucks, I did not expect it to be a paid theme. But it is a good theme, so I can understand it might worth 49 USD for some people.\nAnd now, here I am. After recreated the zoomable image part of Menca theme.

But what do I need to write in the config? How do I know what to write?\nFrom here on, my googlefu is being tested again.\nI want zsh Ez search, there\u0026rsquo;s wiki page for it here. It\u0026rsquo;s kinda crazy now that I think about it. I can write programs.zsh.enable = true;, rebuild, blam, I got zsh as my default.\nNext, I want to customize zsh. I was ready to copy paste my usual .zshrc, but that\u0026rsquo;s not a very Nix way to do it.\nThe Nix way would be to change the option in the config file. So how do I know what\u0026rsquo;s the avaiable options? At the time I had no idea, so I used GitHub search and try to find .nix file with zsh config for reference. That worked just fine, I succeded in porting my .zshrc to use Nix syntax.\n(Later on I learned the existance of MyNixOS but that\u0026rsquo;s story for another time.)\nNext, how do I apply the zsh config to my user only? Applying it globally is acceptable since I\u0026rsquo;m the only user. But it feels dirty since it\u0026rsquo;ll also affect root user.\nOnwards! I found out the existance of Home Manager\nUnto the Home Manager Initially I ignored Home Manager since it has a bit scary warning:\nWords of warning Unfortunately, it is quite possible to get difficult to understand errors when working with Home Manager. You should therefore be comfortable using the Nix language and the various tools in the Nix ecosystem.\nIf you are not very familiar with Nix but still want to use Home Manager then you are strongly encouraged to start with a small and very simple configuration and gradually make it more elaborate as you learn.\n\u0026hellip;\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m new and not familiar with Nix, let\u0026rsquo;s try it anyway, what could possibly go wrong?\nYep, I tried following the install Home Manager as NixOS module and couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out why rebuild is failing.\nAfter a quick googling, I found this blog post that describes exactly what I want.\nThis time I followed the steps carefully and\u0026hellip; it worked!\nIt was the release channel. I didn\u0026rsquo;t read the manual close enough and just run this:\nsudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because it\u0026rsquo;s the master branch release channel. While I\u0026rsquo;m at 22.11. So the weird error I\u0026rsquo;m seeing is from the release channel mismatch. Rebuild works after I added the correct release channel:\nsudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-22.11.tar.gz home-manager Okay, I got per user config working. It\u0026rsquo;s time to add more packages!\nInfinite Packages and Beyond The fact that I can create separate config file for each package, have the options isolated, and config files not spread all over the places is SUPER nice. I got too used by the usual pattern where I need to read each package manual to figure out where the config file is located.\nAlso, the fact that I can declare all the global packages in the config is nice.\n{ pkgs, ... }: { environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ curl file htop lsof nixpkgs-fmt wget ]; } It\u0026rsquo;s not everyday I need to reinstall global packages, so usually it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter that much. But recently I started using GitHub Codespaces at work. And since it\u0026rsquo;s a throwaway env, I need to reinstall and reconfigure the packages again. It would be nice if I have Home Manager that would install and configure everything in Codepaces, something to look into later. Specifying the needed packages in Codepsaces config doesn\u0026rsquo;t work really for packages that\u0026rsquo;s not used by the whole team since the preinstalled packages are shared.\nUsing VS Code with Remote - SSH Remote - SSH extension doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out of the box with NixOS. Trying to connect immediately will fail with remote VS Code SSH server failure.\nThankfully someone already identified the cause and shared the fix here. After applying the fix and rebuild, VS Code Remote - SSH work flawlessly.\nAdding Tailscale I love Tailscale, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to install it here too. Installing was straightforward since Tailscale provide installation manual.\nUnfortunately I\u0026rsquo;m getting high CPU usage after enabling Magic DNS in Tailscale. After reporting it here and tinkering with it, I think it\u0026rsquo;s fixed for now. Will write about in a separate post as the fix wasn\u0026rsquo;t a straightforward one.\nClosing Thoughts I can feel it, I\u0026rsquo;m back at the Linux world again. Where I\u0026rsquo;m spending hours just to get things working. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s just because I\u0026rsquo;m not used to Linux, but whenever it\u0026rsquo;s Linux, configuring things and rabbit hole of errors easily devours all my free time. Some time this is fun, but doing this after working hour is a bit tiring. I need to find a good balance between this and other more relaxing hobbies.\nNext will be making Tailscale working!\nPost 18 of #100DaysToOffload.\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/road-to-nixos-install-programs/","summary":"Adding zsh, Home Manager, and VS Code Remote - SSH","title":"Road to NixOS: How do I install programs?"},{"content":"Disclaimer: This series is not a guide nor a walkthrough for NixOS. This is intended to be a public notes of my journey here.\nWhy? Indo\u0026rsquo;s goverment announced extended holiday for 28-30 June 20231. This gives me unexpected free time. So I decided to tinker with NixOS. Migrating an existing Ubuntu 18 hobby server that has a bunch of services running in it should be enough learning material.\nToe Dipping Before renting a cloud host, I want to try NixOS locally first. What I tried:\nNixOS on WSL This kinda work thanks to community effort in NixOS-WSL. There are plethora of issues stemming from WSL. Most of them have known workaround, so I kept trying. Until docker happened. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect to docker container running in NixOS from Windows. The maintainer of NixOS-WSL seems to experience the same issue2. I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar enough with WSL and NixOS to debug this, dropping\u0026hellip;\nNixOS as guest VM (VirtualBox) I have a bunch of ancient Arch Linux VMs here, they all work great. Then NixOS should work just fine right? Well yes, until I tried to reboot the NixOS. Seems like the drive where NixOS is not bootable? I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s because I used the minimal NixOS image when installing, instead of using the one with desktop environment included.\nI was proven wrong. After reading the manual again, the minimal image boots into the installer, not an installed NixOS3. Following the manual seems easy enough, but I doubt it\u0026rsquo;s worth to do on a throwaway VM.\nNixOS-Infect entered the room What is this? A script to install NixOS on non-NixOS hosts.\nNixOS-Infect is so named because of the high likelihood of rendering a system inoperable. Use with extreme caution and preferably only on newly provisioned systems.\nhttps://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect\nI stumbled over this when searching around NixOS. And seeing nixos-infect support the latest LTS Ubuntu (22.04 atm) on Digital Ocean is trigger to use this instead of VM on my desktop.\nSo I went ahead and created a new droplet, AMD CPU + 2 GB RAM. Along this, I also learnt \u0026ldquo;user data\u0026rdquo; which can be used to run script on droplet creation. Specifically I need the user data to run the infect script.\nWhile waiting for the infect script to finish, I learnt few tricks like how to make less follow the tail like docker logs4.\nless +F /tmp/infect.log By the time I looked at the log again, it is already rebooting, which is a good sign!\nFast forward few frames\u0026hellip;\nI tried ssh-ing to the droplet using root user\u0026hellip; it worked, I\u0026rsquo;m in!\nFrom this point, it\u0026rsquo;s all tinkering with the config, learning Nix language, and a lot of sudo nixos-rebuild switch.\nClosing Thoughts I\u0026rsquo;m writing this from the NixOS droplet. So far I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with the result.\nYears ago I set up Arch Linux on a bunch of old laptops and desktops but didn\u0026rsquo;t write anything after it. This time I\u0026rsquo;m determined to leave some notes on the new journey.\nNext post is about making the NixOS more sane as dev environment!\nPost 17 of #100DaysToOffload.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230703173600/https://en.tempo.co/read/1739780/govt-announces-2-eid-al-adha-joint-leave-days-jokowi-confirms\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL/issues/235#issuecomment-1575977960\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-manual\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/474\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/road-to-nixos-infection/","summary":"The start of a journey; migrating a hobby server to NixOS.","title":"Road to NixOS: The Infection"},{"content":"I bought a bunch of goods from Pixiv BOOTH again using Buyee as proxy.

Ever since then, there has been no updates on their social media. That means no new LN from Shiromedia in the last 6 years 🥲.\nMy only salvation is that I\u0026rsquo;ve succeeded in buying every single LN published by Shiromedia for collection.\nEvery LN published by Shiromedia.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know how useful it would be, but I love this kind of book.\nSome of my favourite highlights from the book:\nWhatever the situation, whether you\u0026rsquo;re out in the mountains, on board a plane, or driving cross-country, to \u0026ldquo;survive\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;to outlive, to remain alive or in existence; live on. To continue to exist or live after.\u0026rdquo; After all, that\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;s really all about—about continuing to exist, no matter how dire the circumstances.\nYou have to be prepared—mentally, physijcally, and equipment-wise. You must not ignore the importance of the mental aspects of survival—in particular, stay calm and do not panic. You must have a survival plan that considers the following essential elements: food, fire, water, and shelter (as well as signals and first aid). And you just never know when things might take a turn for the worse. Or the worst.\nThankfully, the first key to surviving any worst-case scenario is simply this:\nDo Not Panic.\nDestroy your passport (unless you’re French). A passport will allow pirates to quickly identify you and demand ransom from family members; Americans, Brits, and citizens of other wealthy Western nations make appealing targets. Pirates are less likely to kidnap French citizens, due to the French government’s steadfast refusal to negotiate—and recent deadly counterattacks by the French military. If you speak French, use it.\nHigh-risk search teams keep the following phrase in mind at all times: Look for the presence of the unusual or the absence of the usual\nAdmit your own fallibility, even if the gaslighter will not.\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;We are all occasionally name-callers, or hypocrites, or incorrect in our beliefs—I am simply able to acknowledge to that. You seem unable to do so.\u0026rdquo;\nAgree to disagree.\nYou will never win an argument with a gaslighter—just stay true to your own values and beliefs, and let the conflict subside.\nDo not immediately assume that a clown is dangerous.\nIs the clown on the street in broad daylight?\nLikelihood: SAFE\nIs the clown hiding in the woods, bushes, or a sewer drain?\nLikelihood: DANGEROUS\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west—even in Australia.\nThough seemingly impossible, begin to limit your time online. Start with five hours online a day, and slowly reduce time online by one hour a day for four days. Consider learning a new skill (cooking, painting, surgery) to fill your newly free time.\nThe longer the water boils, the more microorganisms that are killed. Beyond 10 minutes, however, no further purification occurs.\nI thoroughly enjoyed their mix of useful trivia, I-probably-will-never-use-this information, examples and illustrations. And the sprinkled jokes here and there is the icing on the cake.\nReading the experts and sources also amaze me on all these peoples doing things that are extraordinary from my point of view.\nSome new things I learnt from the experts section:\ntauromaquia: bullfighting. demolition derby: last man standing brawl with cars. psycho-proctologist: someone who tries to define the definition of assholes.

Over the time these list might get outdated as the streaming platform keep updating their site.\nASOBI STAGE Note: ASOBI STAGE is different with ASOBI CHANNEL. ASOBI CHANNEL is more like YouTube, free to watch platform, and has different set of issues with ASOBI STAGE.\nLink: https://asobistage.asobistore.jp\nPreviously watched:\n2024-08-09, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初声公演- (Nagoya, special) 2024-08-17, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初声公演- (Umeda, day-night) 2024-08-25, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初声公演- (Shibuya, day-night) 2024-09-07, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初心公演- (Nagoya, special, day) 2024-10-14, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初恋公演- (Umeda, special, day-night) 2024-10-19, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初恋公演- (Hiroshima, day-night) 2024-10-27, 学園アイドルマスター DEBUT LIVE 初 TOUR -初恋公演- (Shibuya, day-night) Verdict: totally worth it to watch Idolm@ster live in real time!\nThe platform is pretty good, there are no major problems. There are hiccups where video does not play but comments keep flowing, but a refresh or two fixed it. Also the light stick below the video player is a really nice touch. And the fact you can control it with your phone is a proof they\u0026rsquo;re putting a lot of effort into this.\nArchive also works great, their viewing period is a bit short though, around 2 weeks or so.\nA slight annoyance: the comments section often stop scrolling midway during live, scrolling manually to the bottom can fix it. But often it also scrolls the main view instead of just the comment section. Not sure if this is specific to my environment or not.\neplus Link: https://ib.eplus.jp\nLast watched: 2023-03-18, hololive 4th fes.\nVerdict: avoid if possible 👎\nOkay-ish for watching the live stream. Unusable for watching the archives.

But the way they handle the end of service wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. There\u0026rsquo;s only 2-3 months gap between the announcement (2023-11-30) and the closure (2024-01). And no partial refunds for those paying annual subscriptions. Sure now they\u0026rsquo;re hosting all the contents for free now, but there\u0026rsquo;s no way these archives will be hosted online forever.\nNow hololive is hosting their exclusive content on YouTube membership instead.\n(Also their announcement page doesn\u0026rsquo;t load when opened from Internet Archive. Which means their website kinda sucks according to my personal standards.)\nPrevious impression (2023-06-18) A relatively new hololive exclusive platform, showed up at early 2022. Surprisingly decent considering it\u0026rsquo;s their own platform and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the same problem with Niconico even though they list Dwango in the footer1.\nTheir website feels weird though with all commenters\u0026rsquo; name feels generated (2023-06-17: Seems like this is no longer the case, names are no longer bot-like). And most of the videos views and comments are weirdly exact multiples of thousand.\nAlso, they stopped supporting Firefox on 2023-05-302. Which is a sad thing, but not a deal breaker.\nNiconico (Dwango) Link: https://live.nicovideo.jp\nLast watched: 2023-03-15, Nornis 1st live\nVerdict: video stream quality sucks, archive not included 😭\nSame old nico nico douga but with different name. Functionally, it\u0026rsquo;s great. Practically, I can\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nLast time I watched Nornis\u0026rsquo; live, it\u0026rsquo;s still stutter on lowest stream quality. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if what\u0026rsquo;s causing it, but Niconico connection to Indo has never been good regardless of ISP. Plus, to watch archive (Timeshift in Niconico) you need to subscribe to their premium service(2023-06-17: cost JPY 550 per month).\nSPWN Link: https://virtual.spwn.jp\nPreviously watched:\n2020-12-21, hololive 2nd fes \u0026ldquo;Beyond the Stage\u0026rdquo; 2021-02-17, hololive 1st live \u0026ldquo;Bloom\u0026rdquo; 2021-10-21, Hoshimachi Suisei 1st solo live \u0026ldquo;STELLAR into the GALAXY\u0026rdquo; 2022-03-20, hololive 3rd fes \u0026ldquo;Link Your Wish\u0026rdquo; Verdict: pretty safe choice if available 👍\nLatest impression (2022-ish) So far the most platform I\u0026rsquo;ve been using and has the least problem with. From time to time has bad connection to Indo even after turning on low latency mode on their video player.\nYouTube (member only live, kinda counts) Link: https://youtube.com\nLast watched: pretty much every month\nVerdict: probably the live you want to watch is not here 😔\nIt\u0026rsquo;s YouTube. They probably have the best infra for running live stream in the world right now.\nBut they don\u0026rsquo;t run ticketing for one-time watch.\nZaiko Link: https://zaiko.io\nPreviously watched:\n2023-01-28, Hoshimachi Suisei 2nd solo live \u0026ldquo;Shout in Crisis\u0026rdquo; 2024-05-04, Hanabasami Kyo 4th one-man live \u0026ldquo;FLORIST\u0026rdquo; Verdict: works great except for the occasional stutters\nLatest impression (2024-05-05) Honestly I forgot about this site until I tried to buy a new ticket this year. Then I realized I have an account already in my password manager.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember anything noteworthy from the first impression. Which is a good sign, no major issue back then.\nBut during the FLORIST live, there are stutters. And it\u0026rsquo;s the type where the stream repeats the stuttered part. e.g. lyrics: one two three, stream: one two two three. \u0026ldquo;Hmm, is it a remix? I don\u0026rsquo;t remember this part\u0026rdquo; is what I initially thought. Turns out no, it was stream issues.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see change in graphic quality during stutters. So I doubt it\u0026rsquo;s caused by the \u0026ldquo;auto\u0026rdquo; quality in the video player settings. Which should result in video downgrade if the player decides to lower the quality during the stutter. I also don\u0026rsquo;t see the stutters during archive playback.\nOther than that stutters, Zaiko works great.\nSome neutral stuffs:\nHovering cursor on seek bar in archive give visual preview, which is great. Not every platform has this basic stuff. There\u0026rsquo;s no live chat replay in archive? I don\u0026rsquo;t really read the chat, but it sure feels weird looking at empty chats during archive.

Smooth live, good video and audio quality, works on Firefox, and watch archive works! (Even during ~8 hours long stream, it\u0026rsquo;s relatively smooth)\nI also tried from Firefox + Linux and Safari + iPadOS combination, they\u0026rsquo;re superb!\nPrevious impression (2023-09-13) Watched yet another big event, and there\u0026rsquo;s a blackout mid stream. No sound, no video. They said the troubles only last 90s, but it felt like forever3. With the live comments still running, I saw a lot of frustrated comments. That makes me feel sad. It was a theatrical type event and setting the mood was pretty important. And the blackout ruined the mood buildup for me.\nWith all the recent troubles, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to lose faith in Z-aN 🙁\nPrevious impression (2023-09-03) Still my favorite platform, everything from my first impression still applies (assuming the site isn\u0026rsquo;t down if they\u0026rsquo;re hosting a big event with \u0026gt;100k viewers). And they even fixed the errors on Firefox.\nOn 2023-08-26, their site couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle the load from Hololive Splash Party though4. The live postponed live that day never happened. It become a recording distributed on YouTube and the live ticket refunded. I did not expect them to fail that bad. Live viewers count should be under 200k from my estimates.\nAlso saw nginx error page from their site that day. Weird feeling but I feel relaxed after realizing they also use some familiar tech in their stack.\nUnrelated to the platform itself but I have to say this: if you\u0026rsquo;re even remotely interested with the idea of a virtual singer singing cool songs in a future dystopian world, you need to watch this live. It\u0026rsquo;s AMAZING and you won\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\n2023-09-03: KOKO one-man live is just to good I had to forgive Z-aN for their previous issues.\nFirst impression (2023-06-17) First time watched on Z-aN, surprisingly a great platform! Good to the point it become a trigger for me to make this notes. From registration flow, payment (it uses Stripe at the moment), stream connection, archives, even bonus digital goods from buying tickets, this Z-aN tick all the boxes.\nOther issues My only gripe is Z-aN is unusable on Firefox. Works smoothly on Vivaldi so I have not tried other browsers. They fixed it as of 2023-08-27! Hooray 🥳\nOn Firefox, after few mins the video player will error out, needing a page refresh\nTrivia Bonus: Z-aN wants me to enter my date of birth as a single-byte number, I have no idea how to convert a date into a single byte.\nWhy did you write this? Starting to lose track with the many live streaming platform out there. As these live streams ticket aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly cheap, I created this note to avoid using the bad ones if possible. Most of the time there\u0026rsquo;s no choices though. Even when there are choices, at most it\u0026rsquo;s 2, it\u0026rsquo;s pick bad or the less bad one 🥲.\nChangelog 2024-10-27: more Gakumas live via ASOBI STAGE 2024-09-28: add ASOBI STAGE 2024-05-05: more Z-aN updates, add Zaiko 2023-09-13: update Z-aN entry, issues keep happening 2023-09-03: update Z-aN entry, add KOKO one-man live pic 2023-06-17: initial version Post 13 of #100DaysToOffload.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230617152311/https://hololive-fc.com/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230617155122/https://hololive-fc.com/notification/114\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230913181459/https://www.zan-live.com/en/news/333#:~:text=Regarding%20the%20livestream%20of%20Blue%20Journey%201st%20Live%20%22Yoake%20no%20Uta%2C%22%20which%20took%20place%20on%20September%2013%2C%202023%2C%20we%20regret%20to%20inform%20you%20that%20there%20was%20an%20incident%20of%20approximately%201%20minute%20and%2030%20seconds%20of%20disruption%20in%20both%20video%20and%20audio%20due%20to%20equipment%20troubles%2C%20which%20occurred%20at%20around%2019%3A33.%C2%A0\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230913181611/https://www.zan-live.com/en/news/328\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/picking-paid-live-stream-platform-as-viewer/","summary":"Short note comparing between available live stream platform","title":"Picking Paid Live Stream Platform as Viewer"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Zwift with a Wahoo Kickr for a while.

Internet connection is already close being a public utility. And here I am, having a hard time trying to find decent ISP that can provides service to my place.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to change providers since at least 4 months ago. And this effort will probably continue to 2023.\nProvider Checklist I\u0026rsquo;m looking at these things while looking for ISP:\nAvailable at my place (duh) Sane pricing, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to pay for enterprise pricing No scummy practice (ok, maybe at least minimal, none at all is unlikely to exists) Use fiber connection or better No weird quota or policy on rate limiting Good uptime (it\u0026rsquo;s 2022, please don\u0026rsquo;t timeout when it\u0026rsquo;s raining) And these are nice to have but not required:\nInternet only (no, I do not want to subscribe to your whatever TV/CCTV/streaming services) Bring-my-own-modem or at least don\u0026rsquo;t charge me with overpriced modem rent per month to the point I can buy the modem 4 times a year IPv6 support (is this even a thing in Indonesia?) Here I go, checking every single ISP that provides fiber connection and operates in Indonesia. Like every single one of them, from \u0026ldquo;every person know this name\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;is that an actual service name?\u0026rdquo;.\nIs it available in my place? ISP available BaliFiber ❌ Biznet Home ❌ Bnetfit ❌ CBN Fiber ❌ Fiberstream ❌ First Media ✅ Groovy ❌ Iconnet (PLN) ✅ IndiHome (Telkom) ✅ indonet ❔* Indosat HiFi (Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison) ❌ Megavision ❌ MNC Play ❔** MyRepublic ❌ Oxygen.id ✅ Transvision Hi-Speed ❌ XL Home ❌ XL Satu Fiber ❌ *: Not going to bother with ISP targeting enterprise user.\n**: MNC Play requires me to fill a form with personal identification etc. to check for coverage area. I already did that with another ISP, got a lot of spam calls and no coverage, no thanks.\nISP availability last checked at: 2022-12-31\n2023-04-26 - Escape from Jakarta I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be updating this page anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m convinced I don\u0026rsquo;t need to live in this city. There\u0026rsquo;s not much point in finding the ultimate ISP if every other aspects in life also sucks here for me. Might as well try to move to a better place.\n2023-01-09 - Iconnet First time I heard about \u0026ldquo;Iconnet\u0026rdquo; from my coworkers. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s backed by Indo\u0026rsquo;s PLN. I checked their site, apparently my place is covered. But, it\u0026rsquo;s not great according to my source 🫠.\nWhat makes this ISP even funnier is that their own landing page have an empty testimony section.\n2022-12-31 - First Media I already used First Media from the time they start showing up in my area (probably around ~2013). At that time, they provide real fast connection. But over the time, their price keeps climbing while the stability spirals downhill. People I know have been saying this is because they keep adding more customers to existing terminals regardless of the terminal capacity instead of adding more terminals 😕.\nFast forward 10 years later, after asking around, they still have the same issues. Ignoring the ridiculous amount of spam from their marketing, I hate the fact that their prices varies based on how much pressure you put into their customer support or sales. The more you complaint and want to cut their connection, the more discount you get 🤨. Not being transparent with the pricing model is a bad enough sign for me to stay away.\n2022-11-27 - Oxygen.id A promising ISP, if I could actually use it.\n2022-10-01, late night: I applied via their online registration.\nSame day, 9 p.m.: Contacted by their sales via WhatsApp, asking for location coordinates etc.\n2022-10-03: Registration and payment completed, waiting for their technician now.\n2022-10-04: Their technician came while it\u0026rsquo;s raining heavily. Technician said all nearby terminals are full. Need to request validation team and see whether they can free up some unused terminal slots.\n2022-10-10: Call from their sales, validation in progress.\n2022-10-18: Another call from their sales, validation still in progress and might take even more time. They\u0026rsquo;re asking to refund my money for now.\n2022-11-27: I asked the same sales for updates on the validation. No reply.\nLater on their sales did \u0026ldquo;react\u0026rdquo; to my messages though: Truly a 😂 moment.\nNow, I have no idea whether that person just quit from being a sales or it\u0026rsquo;s their official response. There\u0026rsquo;s still some hope from this ISP if I tried to contact them again. But not now, right now I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to sit out months just for them to check whether they have available slots for me or not.\nBonus: I can\u0026rsquo;t login to my customer account after changing the default password to a 25-characters password. Pressing login does nothing, no message or UI feedback whatsoever. I suspect my password is over the length limit they have for password 🙃.\nChangelog 2023-12-03: Found Bnetfit and Fiberstream in some random FB group when trying to troubleshoot dumb NAT issues with Nintendo Switch Post 12 of #100DaysToOffload.\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/fiber-internet-jakarta-and-2022/","summary":"My short journey of trying to find a decent ISP in my place.","title":"Fiber Internet, Jakarta, and 2022"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s that time of the year again, where I\u0026rsquo;m having annual existensial crisis. My favourite way to stop myself from spiraling into despair is to browse the orange site. That day, I found a link to Nikita Voloboev\u0026rsquo;s personal wiki. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the exact link anymore, I think it was some kind of article about configuring macOS. That wiki is massive, I quickly got into the rabbit hole, specifically the psychology section.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not done reading everything there, but there is one piece I really liked, \u0026ldquo;The Melancholy of Subculture Society\u0026rdquo; by Gwern Branwen.\nThat essay hits me close to home. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just my brain pattern matching with what is being described there. But the phenomenon mentioned there eerily match my personal experiences. And here I am, trying to write my story and the dilemma that comes with the choices.\nRationalizing My Choice The point the critic wants to make is that life is short and a zero-sum game. You lose a third of the day to sleep, another third to making a living, and now you’ve little left. To be really productive, you can’t divide your energies across multiple cultures—you can’t be truly successful in mainstream culture, and at the same time be able to devote enough effort in the field of, say, mechanical models⁠, to be called an Otaking⁠. A straddler takes onto his head the overhead of learning and participating in both, and receives no benefits (he will suffer socially in the esteem of the ‘normals’, and will be able to achieve little in his ‘hobby’ due to lack of time and a desire to not go overboard).⁠⁠\nThe otaku \u0026amp; hikikomori recognizes this dilemma and he chooses—to reject normal life! He rejects life in the larger culture for his subculture⁠⁠. It’s a simple matter of comparative advantage⁠; it’s easier to be a big fish in a small pond than in a large one.⁠⁠\nGwern Branwen, The Melancholy of Subculture Society\nTime is arguably one of the most important resources a person can have. And it\u0026rsquo;s finite (until someone proves time travel or immortality is feasible). So, if a person decides to dedicate their time into something they like instead of what is mainstream, that is a rational choice.\nAt the same time, this is a lonely and cold path. Depending on what the person liked, it might be a real niche. Finding communities of same minded people to share findings will be a challenge. Picking a larger subculture that comprises their niche would be an option. At the end of the day, that subculture wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exactly fit the niche. Creating more fragmentations within.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s fine to accept that as the universal truth? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s fine to be part of a subculture that have a member size of one? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s fine to be thrown out like a piece of gear that does not fit anywhere in the mainstream clockwork?\nOpting out from the mainstream should be a choice consciously made, not forced into making.\nAnt Looking at the World The national identity fragments under the assault of burgeoning subcultures. At last, the critic beholds the natural endpoint of this process: the long nightmare of nationalism falls like a weight from the minds of the living, as the nation becomes some lines on a map, some laws you follow. No one particularly cares. The geek thinks, ‘Meh: here, Canada, London, Japan, Singapore—as long as FedEx can reach me and there’s a good Internet connection, what’s the difference?’ (Nor are the technically-inclined alone in this.⁠⁠)\nYou can test this yourself. Tell yourself —‘The country I live in now is the best country in the world for people like me; I would be terribly unhappy if I was exiled.’ If your mental reply goes something like, ‘Why, what’s so special about the USA? It’s not particularly economically or politically free, it’s not the only civilized English-speaking country, it’s not the wealthiest⁠⁠…’, then you are headed down the path of opting out.\nGwern Branwen, The Melancholy of Subculture Society\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but to say yes and yes here. During the time of peace, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to fight for your own country. Especially not when your own countrymen judges yourself based of your grandparents origin. Oh come on, we\u0026rsquo;re both evolved from the same single-celled organism eons ago, why can\u0026rsquo;t we get along? Without the force and will to unite people into a single nation, it\u0026rsquo;s normal for people to flock into their own interests. Opting out from the national culture.\nThe natural reaction from the ruling party of the culture would of course be negative. As a country could not stand by itself. It needs it\u0026rsquo;s people to to keep the culture alive.\nThis is such a weird world. You\u0026rsquo;re born into a group of peoples. You\u0026rsquo;re taught the history and culture of your group. Now you are expected to fight for that culture for your whole life?\nNO! I would argue the rational action is to live and see the world with your own eyes. After that, if you decide to be part of your original culture, that is fine. Or maybe no, you might find a subculture out there that you find worth living for, that is also fine. Being forced into living a culture because the people around you did so is not fine at all. (Realistically, this free choice is hard to execute for various reason.)\nCoping Mechanism Leaving a culture, and joining a subculture, is a way for the monkey mind to cope with the modern world.\nGwern Branwen, The Melancholy of Subculture Society\nI totally agree with this section where being part of a subculture is a way to free yourself from the bigger culture. Not to the point it become escapism. But to be a healthy person, not under any pressure to be the very best while sacrificing everything.\nA natural thing that would happen just like how: a father want to be best dad in the family, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about being the best dad in the solar system; a kid want to be the fastest kid in the class, that kid wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care about being the fastest person in the continent.\nCongratulations! You Have Won The Knowledge This is the curse of knowledge: those who know, do not do—and those who do not know, do.\nGwern Branwen, The Melancholy of Subculture Society\nThe curse of knowledge, that is probably my favourite quote from the essay. Calling it a curse is really clever. Some times it\u0026rsquo;s painful, holding a knowledge, you agonize over telling the truth to the other person. You can lessen your pain by sharing the burden of knowledge, at the cost of hurting others.\nSubculture for Life If someone really prefers their subculture, which gives them mental ease and physical health, then what right do the rest have to interfere and drag them into the main culture? Large homogeneous cultures are accomplished only with great effort, and much bloodshed of body and mind. Their benefits are unclear, and the justifications transparently self-serving. Perhaps we should accept gracefully the inevitable sundering of ‘national’ cultures, and learn to operate within a truly multicultural world. Each of us with a niche of our own, on respectful (if uncomprehending) terms with all the other subcultures.\nGwern Branwen, The Melancholy of Subculture Society\nAs the subcultures are formed as a resting place and coping mechanism, people with the same subculture will naturally flock together after some time. Are the bigger cultures destinied to be broken into pieces? And small subcultures will eventually grow into mainstream culture? Will this cycle repeats just like how history is believed to repeats itself?\nMaybe at the end, the disappearance of subcultures doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. People lived their lives, believing in their choices. Good or bad, matter not. Who am I to judge them?\nOmake - Behind the Text The melancholy essay written by Gwern don\u0026rsquo;t have the answer I\u0026rsquo;m looking for in my life.

I\u0026rsquo;m not entitled to any of it\u0026rsquo;s features. But it\u0026rsquo;s still frustating when a button or dropdown is not there when I want to click on it.\nFew months ago they removed the ability to sort from the oldest video in a channel. Leaving only sort alphabetically and from the most popular video. So if I I\u0026rsquo;m interested in a channel and want to see the older videos, I need to scroll all the way to the bottom, loading every videos in-between.\nBut now, the dropdown itself is gone! No more channel videos sort for me.\nIs it a technical limitation? Operating at the scale of YouTube would probably have problems I\u0026rsquo;ll never encounter in my whole life.\nOr is it decided by the higher ups after looking at some numbers? An arbitrary decision because only small percentage of the users click on the dropdown.\nI probably will never know why they removed the sort dropdown.\nOr why they keep changing the border radius.\nOr why they reintroduced the dark theme as \u0026ldquo;ambient mode\u0026rdquo;.\nOr why they keep stuffing things in channel name row when watching a video, so I can only see 5 chars of the channel name and 6 buttons in the same row.\nOr why they make only 8 playlists visible at a time when saving a video. At least give me an inline search or show a bigger modal.\nOr why they keep pushing for Shorts to my face.\nMy biggest gripe is that they never communicate most of these changes. One day you open the website and part of the website just changed. It could be a slap-in-the-face or did-this-text-size-increase-by-one-px kind.

I was an idealist and foolish college freshman at the time. Things happened, and fast forward 7 years later, my Pi was collecting dust. And here I am thinking want I want to do over the new year break. So, as a QoL improvement to my home network, it might be nice to have a Pi-hole.\nI\u0026rsquo;m surprised the SD card is still alive and it\u0026rsquo;s still running 2018\u0026rsquo;s version Raspbian. Hardware also looks good, so I proceed to nuke the SD card and install the latest OS. Seems like Raspbian is no longer a thing, they have Raspberry Pi OS now1.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t even take 3 hours to get everything running and working. I expected it to take a lot more time as I\u0026rsquo;m setting this up while having lunch.\nRaspberry OS download and write to SD (30 mins) They have official imaging utility now, downloading the image and writing it to the SD card is a breeze now2. My internet speed sucks though, so the download still take some time. Setup static IP for the Pi (needed for Pi-hole) (10 mins) I hate the built-in interface of the ISP provided router with passion (it\u0026rsquo;s Huawei from IndiHome BTW). It is sluggish and hard to navigate. Install and set-up Pi-hole on the Pi (20 mins) Pi-hole has install script, and that really helps saving some time3. Yes, running unknown script from the internet is dangerous, I understand the risk. Finding admin account for my ISP provided router (10 mins) I just realized the admin user that I use cannot be used to change the DNS server settings. Google here I go. Thankfully I found an user I can use real quick, it\u0026rsquo;s telecomadmin4. Change default DNS server to Pi-hole in the home router (5 mins) Test everything is working (60 mins and counting) So far it\u0026rsquo;s working great!\nI\u0026rsquo;m feeling happy when looking at the queries blocked number going up.\nI still need to figure out some things though:\nWhy some query didn\u0026rsquo;t go through Pi-hole? How do I back up the SD card? The 7 y.o. SD card won\u0026rsquo;t last forever. Can I lower the Raspbian temperature? Making it sit in on top of a running router does not help at all. Do I need to set up HTTPS for the console? Should I set up my VPN to use Pi-hole as the DNS server? I\u0026rsquo;m already using Tailscale for VPN and the Pi is connected to it. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll have an answer after running Pi-hole for a month or so. Tailscale also have official guide here, so this should be a supported use case. Should I set up unbound?

Fluff is an extensible and modular linter designed to help you write good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits your database.\nFrom https://www.sqlfluff.com\nEarlier today at work, I was helping my coworker debugging his SQL. The SQL was fairly simple. It creates a few tables, create some foreign keys, and insert some data.\nBut when we execute the SQL, it is failing. Part of the SQL looks like this:\nINSERT INTO \u0026#34;public\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;some_table\u0026#34; (\u0026#34;category\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;) VALUES (\u0026#34;drama\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tears and blood\u0026#34;); And the DB spits out this error:\nSQL Error [42703]: ERROR: column \u0026#34;drama\u0026#34; does not exist A battle-hardened SQL veteran would probably notice the issue immediately. But it\u0026rsquo;s not very clear to regular human like me.\nIf you guessed the problem is the quotes, then you\u0026rsquo;re correct. String value must use single quotes as the double quotes is reserved for objects in PostgreSQL, like table and column names1.\nI found it out after a bit of trial and error, a bit of headbanging, and no googling attempt. Which leads to me trying to find the tool to help writing an actually valid SQL, not one that looks kinda valid but not really. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I found this fluff, which give somewhat better error message:\nL057 2 / 22 Do not use special characters in identifiers. Hey, at least it\u0026rsquo;s not complaining about \u0026ldquo;no drama\u0026rdquo;.

It\u0026rsquo;s already this late!?\nI started touching the codebase for this blog at 8pm. Why would it take 6 hours just to write some texts?\nOkay, tracking back my steps. This is my Windows machine, it\u0026rsquo;s been forever since I used it to write anything including codes. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s just a glorified media player or video editing workhorse. Oh all the distractions in this entertainment device\u0026hellip;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m typing on a \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; keyboard, my first split keyboard. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have arrow keys. It has trackball and trackpoint on it though. Turns out not having a dedicated arrow keys is a major productity killer for me right now. Most common text manipulation shortcut I use needs arrow keys. And adding one extra mod key to press doesn\u0026rsquo;t help. It puts my hand into a really clunky position. And you can throw muscle memory out of the window.\nThe wooden palm rest is nice though.\nI also tried setting up Sapling, a git compatible SCM. Super interesting for me as I like the stacked PR approach. Maybe if I use it here, it will give me some good productivity and mood boost! 1 hour trying, and\u0026hellip; nope. I will stick with plain old git. It is compatible with git, but you can\u0026rsquo;t use existing local git repo and start using sl (Sapling binary, equivalent to git) right away. You need to clone the remote again using sl clone as it use .sl instead of .git. The fact that sl errors with abort: '\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;' is not inside a repository, but this command requires a repository! does not help all. (Google only return 1 hit for that error and it\u0026rsquo;s the source repo :), thankfully someone posted an issue upstream and has provided solution there, so thanks for that.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not only that, I also had a bunch of problem with sub modules and default-push behavior not working correctly. The web manual and help output from the binary also doesn\u0026rsquo;t match. Undocumented commands here and there. Sapling is cool, probably it works great in Meta, but for me and my solo micro sized project, nah.\nAfter that, I also had to deal with a bunch of Windows env things. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I already have hugo binary installed and ready to use. Why would I get unknown command when running it? Maybe I fucked up some time ago, maybe a Windows update, maybe a rogue install script, who knows? Here we go, spelunking into Windows system env just to run a binary without specifying the full path every single time.\nOkay, Windows env all fixed up, good path, binary is in the path, all good. Or not, still not found in built-in command prompt in VSCode. Yes I opened a new prompt, not working. Closed all open prompt, reopen, still not working. I\u0026rsquo;m tired, a full restart will definitely fix this and that\u0026rsquo;s what I do.\nThe turn off and then on again trick sure works! (Later on I realized restarting just VSCode also works)\nNow we have everything, I would start writing right? Turns out no, I just had to try and clean things up. Documents things here and there, setup justfile (Makefile alternative for running commands, not building) and all the mumbo jumbo since this is my first time using it.\nFinally, here we are nearing the end of the post. It\u0026rsquo;s not even 1 hour to write all this messy ramblings.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s past 2am now and I realized it\u0026rsquo;s really hard for me to focus right now, I would make excuses to avoid doing things to myself. I just want to write right now. I don\u0026rsquo;t care whether people read this or not. Cleaning and documenting things here are nice, not much point if only I used it though.

I have zero idea why, but connecting that old HDMI cable to the USB Hub and it worked! Mac could properly detect the monitor now. The only thing I can identify from the cable is E202584 AWM from a company called Linkiss.\nIn a way, I wasted a total of IDR 319K for unused cables and few hours to look into the cause.

Usually they sell the official goods through BOOTH or Geek Jack. Geek Jack ships globally, but BOOTH ship to Japan address only. So I need another proxy service like Buyee if I were to buy from BOOTH.\nI want to compare the experience of buying the goods through Buyee and Geek Jack, so I will keep notes of them here.\nData All prices are in JPY. Prices doesn\u0026rsquo;t include customs tax etc. Service fee include things like consolidation and protective packages. Some goods are pre-ordered, so the total days doesn\u0026rsquo;t count the days where the service are waiting for the goods to be shipped from the seller.\nGoods Goods Price Service Service Fee Delivery Fee Date Bought Received After x Days Total Days Hoshimachi Phone Case + T-Shirt 8500 Buyee 1800 3442 25-06-2020 27 27 Watame Birthday 2020 Full Set 10000 Geek Jack - 2000 11-07-2020 102 19 Marin Birthday 2020 Full Set 10000 Buyee 1800 3080 07-08-2020 133 8 Shion 2nd Anniv Full Set 10000 Buyee 1800 2810 18-08-2020 122 23 Mio Birthday 2020 Full Set 9000 Buyee 800 3991 11-09-2020 102 6 Beyond the Stage Supporting Set + Tapestry 13000 Geek Jack - 2400 24-10-2020 ~93 12 Beyond the Stage Hoodie 7500 Geek Jack - 2400 30-10-2020 ~87 12 Hoshimachi 500K Subs Goods 11000 Buyee 800 3265 19-10-2020 151 17 Shirakami Birthday 2020 Full Set 10000 Buyee 800 3265 6-10-2020 164 17 Services Comparison Order status tracking Both services provide the order status. Buyee displays the order status on the site and sends notification email. Geek Jack only show something like \u0026ldquo;Order Status Succeeded\u0026rdquo; in the site. Everything else goes to the email. They\u0026rsquo;ll sent something like \u0026ldquo;The benefits of [Goods Name] will arrive at our warehouse next week. We will start shipping as soon as possible.\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it looks on Buyee\u0026rsquo;s site\nOverall, there\u0026rsquo;s not much difference for the order status udaptes other than the misleading status in the Geek Jack site.\nBuying limited quantity goods Since Buyee is a proxy service, when I buy goods through Buyee, I need to wait for someone from Buyee confirm my order and buy it for me. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s an automated service or there\u0026rsquo;s an actual person doing it behind the scene. All of my orders are bought within 24 hours, there are also times when the items are bought within 1 hour, which is really fast!\nMost of the time, that service speed is good enough. But things are different for limited quantity goods! Stuffs like full set goods that have postcard with handwritten autograph as bonus will be out of stock in no time. Just like the previous Ayame Birthday 2020 pack which sold out in less than 2 minutes. Buyee service doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for goods like that!\nSo I tried using Geek Jack for limited goods. Spoiler: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end well. The website doesn\u0026rsquo;t load at all when a new limited goods are released! I guess everyone outside of Japan had the same idea and flocked to Geek Jack to buy it. And boom, connection timed out! Waited a bit and reloaded the page\u0026hellip; I was greeted by a big \u0026ldquo;SOLD OUT\u0026rdquo; plastered over the goods page. That\u0026rsquo;s it, I\u0026rsquo;m buying the replica autograph set 🙂.\nBoth Buyee and Geek Jack doesn\u0026rsquo;t work really well for limited quantity goods. I think I need to use something like forwarding service from Tenso so I can buy it directly from the seller. I\u0026rsquo;ll try it in the future.\nDelivery courier choices Buyee support various delivery, but most of them have low upper limit for size or weight1. So most of the time, the only ones available are EMS(Japan Post International Courier), DHL, and Japan Post Seamail.\nThese are the available methods at Buyee on March 2021\nMeanwhile, Geek Jack only ships with EMS, so there\u0026rsquo;s no choice there2.\nUpdates: On January 2021, Geek Jack seems to ship my package with ECMS instad of EMS. When the package arrived in Indonesia, I got contacted by their staff, asking confirmation whether I want to pay for the tax or not. Then I got hit by expensive entry tax that basically doubles the price. At this point I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can recommend Geek Jack over Buyee for cheaper total fee.\nPrices The prices aspect is pretty hard to compare. Mostly it depends on what I buy, which additional services I use, and which delivery courier I pick.\nIf I wanted to buy one item, I think I might prefer Geek Jack for it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity. Most of the time, the delivery price is included in the goods price, no extra charges whatsoever. They\u0026rsquo;re around 2000 to 3000 JPY. So I can just add to cart, pay for it, and done.\nWhen the delivery fee is not included, it\u0026rsquo;ll be added on the checkout process. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s 2400 JPY.\nWith Buyee, since it\u0026rsquo;s a proxy service, I can actually buy multiple items from different sellers. Those items will be stored in their warehouse until I decide when to ship them. They offer free storage for 30 days, which is plenty enough.\nThere are two services from Buyee that I usually use, package consolidation and protective packaging. Package consolidation is just a service to consolidate multiple packages into a single package. It costs 500 JPY to consolidate 2 packages3. They might still split it into multiple packages if it\u0026rsquo;s too big though. And the protective packaging is another optional service which they add a bunch of air bags and other protective packaging to the goods4.\nThese are the air bags from Buyee\nIt costs 1500 JPY, which is pretty expensive in my opinion. But I don\u0026rsquo;t want to take any risk when buying fragile goods like acrylic panel, so I opted in anyway.\nOther than that, Buyee also charges for the shipping fee from the seller to Buyee. From my experience, they ranges from 700 to 1000 JPY.\nAfter totalling all the additional services and fee, on average I would pay ~3900 JPY for each package when using Buyee. Which is around 44% more expensive than buying from Geek Jack.\nPayment Both services accepts PayPal, so I don\u0026rsquo;t really try other payment method here.\nDigital items Sometimes the goods include digital items like situational voice or song.\nWith Geek Jack, after purchasing, I can download it from the website. If I remember correctly, they limit it so I can only download it 100 times.\nBut at the time of writing this, they removed the download link. And there\u0026rsquo;s an announcement regarding the digital items on the homepage: \u0026ldquo;After purchasing a digital product, Our customer service will contact you by email for the download link of the digital product.\u0026rdquo;. So I guess I need to contact the customer service if I want to download my old purchases again? I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure about this one but thankfully I already downloaded them all and backed them up.\nMeanwhile, Buyee is not really suitable for digital products, but they still somewhat support it5. Basically, after purchasing the goods, I need to contact the support so they can add the downloadable content to my account.\nAt first, I thought this process was automatic, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t contact the support. But after the physical goods from the same package arrived at my place and I still got no news about the digital items, I decided to contact customer service.\nFor the first inquiry, I used the consolidated package number, and this is their response:\nFri, Dec 18, 2020 at 11:01 Dear Yosua Ian Sebastian, This is the Buyee customer support. Thank you for using our service. In response to your concern for package [REDACTED], upon confirming, we have confirmed that the package has already shipped out from our warehouse. Therefore, we are afraid to inform you that we are unable to meet your request this time. We are afraid we can no longer contact the seller for any inquiry. Basically, the purpose of contacting the seller is to gather information about the item and it should be done prior to bidding or any transactions. Thank you in advance for your understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns. Sincerely, [REDACTED] Buyee customer support Okay, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound really good. I know that BOOTH should still have the download link available since the product was relatively new.\nSo I tried to contact the customer support one more time, this time using the individual package number instead of the consolidated one.\nAnd they replied:\nFri, Dec 18, 2020 at 17:13 Dear Yosua Ian Sebastian, This is the Buyee customer support. Thank you for using our service. Regarding the auction ID [REDACTED], we will contact the seller to arrange the transaction. We have confirmed from our related department that the voice packs of these items will be available on January 31, 2021. It usually takes around 2-3 business days for the code/information to be shown on your \u0026#34;My Page\u0026#34; once available. You will be notified by email after the code/information is available, and you will find it in the \u0026lt;Digital Products\u0026gt; section of your \u0026#34;My Page\u0026#34;. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns. Sincerely, [REDACTED] Buyee customer support Nice! There\u0026rsquo;s still some hope to get my digital goods! I haven\u0026rsquo;t got any email notification regarding it after one week has passed though. Probably I\u0026rsquo;ll wait until the holiday season is over before contacting the customer support again.\nOverall, both of them are kinda questionable regarding digital goods. So, if the goods are digital only, there\u0026rsquo;s no physical goods in the set, buying directly on BOOTH might be better.\nChanging delivery address Changing the delivery address is only possible before the goods are shipped(duh).\nFor Buyee, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to select a different address before shipping, simple enough.\nFor Geek Jack, I need to contact the customer service to change the delivery address. It\u0026rsquo;s simple enough though, I just need to specify the order ID and new address. Usually they also send confirmation email for the address before shipping, so I can also reply that email.\nInsurance Now this part is something I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully explored.\nThe standard plan for Buyee includes insured delivery and inspection. The insured delivery covers for damage during transit etc. While the inspection will check for mismatch between the delivered goods and the online description. That standard plan only costs 500 JPY, so I always use it6. And I never got mismatch or damaged product, so I can\u0026rsquo;t comment too much on the service itself.\nGeek Jack seems to accept exchanging damaged item: \u0026ldquo;If the item was damaged at the time of receipt, please send us email with the picture to know the damaged parts and the receiving date and time. We accept exchanging or returning within seven days of the arrival of the item.\u0026rdquo;7 But I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it before, probably the delivery cost is going to sting a bit.\nConclusion If the goods are available on Geek Jack, it might be cheaper and easier to just buy it from them. (Assuming they still use EMS.) For now I prefer using Buyee to buy it from BOOTH.\nIn the future I think I\u0026rsquo;ll try buying through Indonesian based proxy service like kyou.id.\nReferences https://web.archive.org/web/20201227111304/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/shipping-method?lang=en\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201227111350/https://www.geekjack.net/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201222115318/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/consolidate\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201222115304/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/packing\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201227121519/https://faq.buyee.jp/article/187?lang=en\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201229091738/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/plans?lang=en\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201229092917/https://www.geekjack.net/faq.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/buyee-or-geekjack/","summary":"My personal experiences from buying VTuber goods through Buyee and Geek Jack.","title":"Buyee or Geek Jack?"},{"content":"Intro \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to try out the new Daddy Caddy!\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what I thought while working on this new site. Caddy just released their v2 the other day. So I wanted to replace my old Nginx server just for the sake of it.\nBefore doing that, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better if I have something to serve from the server.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time for you to graduate from redirect slave!\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s my main reason for making this site. This site is generated with Hugo and using a nice premade theme.\nJust add a bunch of markdowns, modify the config a bit, and maybe tweak the theme fonts, and I\u0026rsquo;m done!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be this easy to make a site that looks nice(in my opinion). Deploying it should also be trivial right? Oh how I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more wrong.\nProblem Initially, I wanted to make the site compile on my machine, pack it up, and scp it to the server.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s boring. And there are other points that I care:\nWhat if I wanted to create a new post on a different machine? Do I need to setup the env on the other machine too? Maybe I want to automatically build if the site repo is updated? Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I want to make the site compile on the server.\nI quickly created a new remote repo, pushed it all up, and then pulled it from the server.\nTo build the site, all I need is just the hugo binary. The server ran on a super common linux distro, should be easy.\nThe installation docs mentioned an official debian package available. Ran sudo apt-get install hugo, and the installation finished without problem. There\u0026rsquo;s a warning about the Linux package usually is a few versions behind. Well, a few versions behind should be fine right?\nSo, I went ahead and built the site, hugo -D, easy peasy. Now just need to serve the build result.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where things start to spiral down.\nWhen I tried opening the site, it\u0026rsquo;s returning 403. Why!?\nOh, maybe I forgot to change the permission for the build result directory. Hmm, no, it\u0026rsquo;s already 755.\nSo I checked the access log. Hmm, it\u0026rsquo;s accessing the right thing, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing out of norm.\nMoving on, I checked the content of the build directory. Aha! There\u0026rsquo;s no index.html in the build result. Which is weird\u0026hellip; Why the resulting build is different here? My machine is MacOS, and I believe in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s cross platform support. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s something else?\nHmmmmm, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the hugo binary itself 🤔. Surprise! Running hugo version gives me v0.40.1. Man this is really old, I could find one or two fossils in here.\nMight as well install the binary with the same version as my machine directly. At the current time, it\u0026rsquo;s v0.71.0. Proceed to download and install the binary, yada yada yada, now I got the same version on the server.\nAfter building with same binary, the output should be the same. Wrong! It still doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate the index.html 😭.\nPretty desperate at this point. Maybe I should recheck the entire source again? Hmm, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing out of the norm. The theme? I highly doubt it, but let\u0026rsquo;s check it anyway.\nHuh? The theme directory is empty? What happened here, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I commited the entire theme to the repo.\nIs it because I used git submodule to add the theme? A quick googling tells me that this is case.\nWhen you clone a project with submodule in it, by default you get the directories that contain submodules, but none of the files within them yet.1\nOMG, all the time I spent debugging this. I probably could save them if I actually read how to use submodules first.\nSince I already cloned the repo, all I need is to fetch the missing submodules. This command did the trick:\n# This command will fetch and update all the submodules in the repo. $ git submodule update --init --recursive Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s the moment of truth.\nYatta! The index.html is here, and I can open the site 🥳🎉.\nNow my old server has been officially promoted to be a redirect servant and HTML server.\nConclusion Be careful when running any commands that you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with. While it might work now. It might cause headache or maybe even trip you in the future. Proceed carefully 😉.\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/wheres-my-index-html/","summary":"How I learned about git submodules behavior when trying to deploy this site.","title":"Where's My index.html?"},{"content":"Unlike other pages in this blog, this page act as information dump about myself where I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about writing useless sentences.\nHow do I see myself? I used to think I\u0026rsquo;m a bit weird, turns out everyone are! I consider myself really bad at communicating things, especially feelings. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m lacking attachment to life. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m too harsh on others or myself (sometimes). I\u0026rsquo;m one of those people that is really quiet at first then become noisy after getting familiar (sometimes). Food? I like potato and any potato derivatives 🥔. I like pasta. I love cheese roll. Fish? I like bandeng, salmon, and tuna. Fruits? I like pineapple, lemon, and banana. Apple is also kinda nice. I like stir fried beef with black pepper. I like salty snacks. Kue kering (cookies)? I like nastar and kastengel. Not a fan of spicy food. Prefer to avoid shady seafoods and mushrooms. Drinks? Water, water, and water. Plain water is good for you. When it\u0026rsquo;s not water, I drink:\na hot cup of coffee with milk almost daily. Might be up to 3 cups on stressful days. flavoured milk, like mochacinno or strawberry. black tea occasionally when I need to warm up my soul. cola, when I need that extra oomph in a day. Oooh all the sugars and soda rushing in 🫨 Life philosophy? 🚧 Warning: I\u0026rsquo;m still in a neverending existential crisis, so this section might change like a rollercoaster ride over the time.\nRecently I learnt about stoicism through wikipedia, and I find it great on teaching me how to face life. Knowing the principles and applying it are two different matters though.\nRationalism is also a thing that I learnt from this article.\nFor now I\u0026rsquo;m trying to align myself with stoicism and rationalism.\nLife goals? Oof, thats a hard question. For now, I just want to be in a state where being alive doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like living hell. To achieve that, my strategies are:\nI need to accept what I have right now I should not be sad for things I don\u0026rsquo;t have I should improve something day-by-day, whether it\u0026rsquo;s living condition, knowledge, or fitness Music? I listen to Japanese songs almost all the time.\nMy older sister listens to Alice Nine years ago, maybe around 2009? As the little brother who likes to copy what the older sibling does, I started listening too and explored other Japanese band. And that continues until now, I still listen to Japanese songs even though I don\u0026rsquo;t speak Japanese.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a specific genre I liked. A good music is a good music, regardless of the genre (good based on my ears and brain).\nIf I had to mention one, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the type of song where at least 2 vocals are singing at the same time with different lyrics. In regular conversation, this kind of voice overlap is usually chaotic. But in a good song composition, there is harmony in it, just like how multiple instruments produce a good melody. I think it\u0026rsquo;s called polyphony but I\u0026rsquo;m not too sure.\nSome example songs are:\n\u0026ldquo;Abysal Zone\u0026rdquo; by Nornis \u0026ldquo;Ray of Hope\u0026rdquo; by Nornis \u0026ldquo;divergence -Yumemiru Futari-\u0026rdquo; by Meramipop \u0026amp; nayuta \u0026ldquo;刹那ティックコード\u0026rdquo; by ときのそら \u0026amp; AZKi \u0026ldquo;餞の鳥\u0026rdquo; by D/Zeal Games? My favorite franchise is Splatoon (probably). After that, there\u0026rsquo;s Pokemon and Ys.\nMy nostalgia game is Pokemon Sapphire.\nI like roguelike game. e.g. Risk of Rain, Risk of Rain 2, and Dead Cells.\nI like watching interactive drama game playthrough. Usually created by Supermassive Games like Until Dawn and The Quarry. Watching, not playing, because I don\u0026rsquo;t have a PS4.\nI used to collect games on Steam. At the time of writing, I have 1077 games.\nI used to spent a lot of hours in online games like Grand Chase, Elsword, and Warframe.\nRandom facts? I am born in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1997 during the financial crisis. I have never met nor seen both of my grandfathers ever, even as a baby. My first name, Yosua, is not given by my parents.
