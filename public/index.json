[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s almost 2am now. What? It\u0026rsquo;s already this late!?\nI started touching the codebase for this blog at 8pm. Why would it take 6 hours just to write some texts?\nOkay, tracking back my steps. This is my Windows machine, it\u0026rsquo;s been forever since I used it to write anything including codes. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s just a glorified media player or video editing workhorse. Oh all the distractions in this entertainment device\u0026hellip;\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m typing on a \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; keyboard, my first split keyboard. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have arrow keys. It has trackball and trackpoint on it though. Turns out not having a dedicated arrow keys is a major productity killer for me right now. Most common text manipulation shortcut I use needs arrow keys. And adding one extra mod key to press doesn\u0026rsquo;t help. It puts my hand into a really clunky position. And you can throw muscle memory out of the window.\nThe wooden palm rest is nice though.\nI also tried setting up Sapling, a git compatible SCM. Super interesting for me as I like the stacked PR approach. Maybe if I use it here, it will give me some good productivity and mood boost! 1 hour trying, and\u0026hellip; nope. I will stick with plain old git. It is compatible with git, but you can\u0026rsquo;t use existing local git repo and start using sl (Sapling binary, equivalent to git) right away. You need to clone the remote again using sl clone as it use .sl instead of .git. The fact that sl errors with abort: '\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;' is not inside a repository, but this command requires a repository! does not help all. (Google only return 1 hit for that error and it\u0026rsquo;s the source repo :), thankfully someone posted an issue upstream and has provided solution there, so thanks for that.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not only that, I also had a bunch of problem with sub modules and default-push behavior not working correctly. The web manual and help output from the binary also doesn\u0026rsquo;t match. Undocumented commands here and there. Sapling is cool, probably it works great in Meta, but for me and my solo micro sized project, nah.\nAfter that, I also had to deal with a bunch of Windows env things. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I already have hugo binary installed and ready to use. Why would I get unknown command when running it? Maybe I fucked up some time ago, maybe a Windows update, maybe a rogue install script, who knows? Here we go, spelunking into Windows system env just to run a binary without specifying the full path every single time.\nOkay, Windows env all fixed up, good path, binary is in the path, all good. Or not, still not found in built-in command prompt in VSCode. Yes I opened a new prompt, not working. Closed all open prompt, reopen, still not working. I\u0026rsquo;m tired, a full restart will definitely fix this and that\u0026rsquo;s what I do.\nThe turn off and then on again trick sure works! (Later on I realized restarting just VSCode also works)\nNow we have everything, I would start writing right? Turns out no, I just had to try and clean things up. Documents things here and there, setup justfile (Makefile alternative for running commands, not building) and all the mumbo jumbo since this is my first time using it.\nFinally, here we are nearing the end of the post. It\u0026rsquo;s not even 1 hour to write all this messy ramblings.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s past 2am now and I realized it\u0026rsquo;s really hard for me to focus right now, I would make excuses to avoid doing things to myself. I just want to write right now. I don\u0026rsquo;t care whether people read this or not. Cleaning and documenting things here are nice, not much point if only I used it though. Next time, I should focus more on the goal and resist the distractions.\nI already had the plan for updating this blog this month, but the final push is seeing this post in HN and saw the 100 posts challenge.\nPost 1 of #100DaysToOffload.\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/focusing-is-hard-for-current-me/","summary":"These days, I can not focus on one thing for extended amount of time.","title":"Focusing Is Hard For Current Me"},{"content":"Monitors Used Dell U2417H [24\u0026quot; 60Hz IPS Monitor] ViewSonic XG2431 [24\u0026quot; 240Hz IPS Monitor] MacOS + ViewSonic Issues Can\u0026rsquo;t use random USB-C cable + USB hub for connecting ViewSonic to M1 MacBook Air running Big Sur.\nMac detected the monitor, but monitor show \u0026ldquo;no signal\u0026rdquo;.\nMaybe cable or hub issue? Used the same exact cable and hub with different monitor, worked.\nMaybe monitor port issue? Used same HDMI port with Windows desktop, worked.\nThen I found this review on Amazon for different ViewSonic model:\nOther reviewers here have noted all the pros about this monitor, I will just add that 1-) the adjustable stand is especially easy to use and useful for long hours and avoiding neck pain and 2-) reminder that they ship only a display port/USB cable and an HDMI cable with it even though monitor is USB -C enabled. if you are running Mojave 10.14 or later the adapters for display port and HDMI simply will not work, the mac book will never see the monitor. You must get a USB-C 3.1 to C cable. Then you can just plug it all in. Also need to add a shout out to Anne at Amazon (complimentary) tech support for helping figure all this out by coordinating with ViewSonic because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t documented anywhere at the point at which I was trying to do it. Thank you Anne!\nbookkook, 2019 March Hey, that problem sounds familiar.\nSo I just learned there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of USB-C variant, and USB-C 3.1 gen 2 is a thing.\nCurrently ordering a new cable, will update later.\nUpdate: It\u0026rsquo;s 2022 and I bought a new cable.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s HDMI to USB-C from Vention. Surprise! It worked! I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the story of the package courier miss-deliver the cable and I had to buy it twice.\nAfter using it a full day without problems, I realized a fatal miss when it\u0026rsquo;s time to charge the laptop. Macbook air only have 2 USB-C ports! 1 for monitor, and the other one for USB hub, this is for keyboard etc. and I can\u0026rsquo;t work without it.\nOkay, back to square one. I tried rummaging through my jumbled mess cable collection and found a HDMI to HDMI cable. Not sure where it\u0026rsquo;s from, maybe from Nintendo Switch. It looks exactly like your average HDMI cable, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty old, but there\u0026rsquo;s no harm in trying it right?\nAnother surprise! I have zero idea why, but connecting that old HDMI cable to the USB Hub and it worked! Mac could properly detect the monitor now. The only thing I can identify from the cable is E202584 AWM from a company called Linkiss.\nIn a way, I wasted a total of IDR 319K for unused cables and few hours to look into the cause. What I learnt from this:\nI have no idea how HDMI works I have even less idea how USB C works Windows + Monitors with Mixed HDR Mode Windows 10 with multi-monitor, but only some of them have support HDR.\nIf HDR is enabled on supported monitors, this will break preview feature from Windows on non-HDR monitor. E.g. win+tab will show black desktop and windows, hovering on running program from taskbar will show black window instead of actual preview.\nSolution, turn off HDR :(\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/monitor-notes/","summary":"A diary of boring adventure in setting up monitors.

Usually they sell the official goods through BOOTH or Geek Jack. Geek Jack ships globally, but BOOTH ship to Japan address only. So I need another proxy service like Buyee if I were to buy from BOOTH.\nI want to compare the experience of buying the goods through Buyee and Geek Jack, so I will keep notes of them here.\nData All prices are in JPY. Prices doesn\u0026rsquo;t include customs tax etc. Service fee include things like consolidation and protective packages. Some goods are pre-ordered, so the total days doesn\u0026rsquo;t count the days where the service are waiting for the goods to be shipped from the seller.\nGoods Goods Price Service Service Fee Delivery Fee Date Bought Received After x Days Total Days Hoshimachi Phone Case + T-Shirt 8500 Buyee 1800 3442 25-06-2020 27 27 Watame Birthday 2020 Full Set 10000 Geek Jack - 2000 11-07-2020 102 19 Marin Birthday 2020 Full Set 10000 Buyee 1800 3080 07-08-2020 133 8 Shion 2nd Anniv Full Set 10000 Buyee 1800 2810 18-08-2020 122 23 Mio Birthday 2020 Full Set 9000 Buyee 800 3991 11-09-2020 102 6 Beyond the Stage Supporting Set + Tapestry 13000 Geek Jack - 2400 24-10-2020 ~93 12 Beyond the Stage Hoodie 7500 Geek Jack - 2400 30-10-2020 ~87 12 Hoshimachi 500K Subs Goods 11000 Buyee 800 3265 19-10-2020 151 17 Shirakami Birthday 2020 Full Set 10000 Buyee 800 3265 6-10-2020 164 17 Services Comparison Order status tracking Both services provide the order status. Buyee displays the order status on the site and sends notification email. Geek Jack only show something like \u0026ldquo;Order Status Succeeded\u0026rdquo; in the site. Everything else goes to the email. They\u0026rsquo;ll sent something like \u0026ldquo;The benefits of [Goods Name] will arrive at our warehouse next week. We will start shipping as soon as possible.\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it looks on Buyee\u0026rsquo;s site\nOverall, there\u0026rsquo;s not much difference for the order status udaptes other than the misleading status in the Geek Jack site.\nBuying limited quantity goods Since Buyee is a proxy service, when I buy goods through Buyee, I need to wait for someone from Buyee confirm my order and buy it for me. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s an automated service or there\u0026rsquo;s an actual person doing it behind the scene. All of my orders are bought within 24 hours, there are also times when the items are bought within 1 hour, which is really fast!\nMost of the time, that service speed is good enough. But things are different for limited quantity goods! Stuffs like full set goods that have postcard with handwritten autograph as bonus will be out of stock in no time. Just like the previous Ayame Birthday 2020 pack which sold out in less than 2 minutes. Buyee service doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for goods like that!\nSo I tried using Geek Jack for limited goods. Spoiler: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t end well. The website doesn\u0026rsquo;t load at all when a new limited goods are released! I guess everyone outside of Japan had the same idea and flocked to Geek Jack to buy it. And boom, connection timed out! Waited a bit and reloaded the page\u0026hellip; I was greeted by a big \u0026ldquo;SOLD OUT\u0026rdquo; plastered over the goods page. That\u0026rsquo;s it, I\u0026rsquo;m buying the replica autograph set 🙂.\nBoth Buyee and Geek Jack doesn\u0026rsquo;t work really well for limited quantity goods. I think I need to use something like forwarding service from Tenso so I can buy it directly from the seller. I\u0026rsquo;ll try it in the future.\nDelivery courier choices Buyee support various delivery, but most of them have low upper limit for size or weight1. So most of the time, the only ones available are EMS(Japan Post International Courier), DHL, and Japan Post Seamail.\nThese are the available methods at Buyee on March 2021\nMeanwhile, Geek Jack only ships with EMS, so there\u0026rsquo;s no choice there2.\nUpdates: On January 2021, Geek Jack seems to ship my package with ECMS instad of EMS. When the package arrived in Indonesia, I got contacted by their staff, asking confirmation whether I want to pay for the tax or not. Then I got hit by expensive entry tax that basically doubles the price. At this point I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can recommend Geek Jack over Buyee for cheaper total fee.\nPrices The prices aspect is pretty hard to compare. Mostly it depends on what I buy, which additional services I use, and which delivery courier I pick.\nIf I wanted to buy one item, I think I might prefer Geek Jack for it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity. Most of the time, the delivery price is included in the goods price, no extra charges whatsoever. They\u0026rsquo;re around 2000 to 3000 JPY. So I can just add to cart, pay for it, and done.\nWhen the delivery fee is not included, it\u0026rsquo;ll be added on the checkout process. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s 2400 JPY.\nWith Buyee, since it\u0026rsquo;s a proxy service, I can actually buy multiple items from different sellers. Those items will be stored in their warehouse until I decide when to ship them. They offer free storage for 30 days, which is plenty enough.\nThere are two services from Buyee that I usually use, package consolidation and protective packaging. Package consolidation is just a service to consolidate multiple packages into a single package. It costs 500 JPY to consolidate 2 packages3. They might still split it into multiple packages if it\u0026rsquo;s too big though. And the protective packaging is another optional service which they add a bunch of air bags and other protective packaging to the goods4.\nThese are the air bags from Buyee\nIt costs 1500 JPY, which is pretty expensive in my opinion. But I don\u0026rsquo;t want to take any risk when buying fragile goods like acrylic panel, so I opted in anyway.\nOther than that, Buyee also charges for the shipping fee from the seller to Buyee. From my experience, they ranges from 700 to 1000 JPY.\nAfter totalling all the additional services and fee, on average I would pay ~3900 JPY for each package when using Buyee. Which is around 44% more expensive than buying from Geek Jack.\nPayment Both services accepts PayPal, so I don\u0026rsquo;t really try other payment method here.\nDigital items Sometimes the goods include digital items like situational voice or song.\nWith Geek Jack, after purchasing, I can download it from the website. If I remember correctly, they limit it so I can only download it 100 times.\nBut at the time of writing this, they removed the download link. And there\u0026rsquo;s an announcement regarding the digital items on the homepage: \u0026ldquo;After purchasing a digital product, Our customer service will contact you by email for the download link of the digital product.\u0026rdquo;. So I guess I need to contact the customer service if I want to download my old purchases again? I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure about this one but thankfully I already downloaded them all and backed them up.\nMeanwhile, Buyee is not really suitable for digital products, but they still somewhat support it5. Basically, after purchasing the goods, I need to contact the support so they can add the downloadable content to my account.\nAt first, I thought this process was automatic, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t contact the support. But after the physical goods from the same package arrived at my place and I still got no news about the digital items, I decided to contact customer service.\nFor the first inquiry, I used the consolidated package number, and this is their response:\nFri, Dec 18, 2020 at 11:01 Dear Yosua Ian Sebastian, This is the Buyee customer support. Thank you for using our service. In response to your concern for package [REDACTED], upon confirming, we have confirmed that the package has already shipped out from our warehouse. Therefore, we are afraid to inform you that we are unable to meet your request this time. We are afraid we can no longer contact the seller for any inquiry. Basically, the purpose of contacting the seller is to gather information about the item and it should be done prior to bidding or any transactions. Thank you in advance for your understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns. Sincerely, [REDACTED] Buyee customer support Okay, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound really good. I know that BOOTH should still have the download link available since the product was relatively new.\nSo I tried to contact the customer support one more time, this time using the individual package number instead of the consolidated one.\nAnd they replied:\nFri, Dec 18, 2020 at 17:13 Dear Yosua Ian Sebastian, This is the Buyee customer support. Thank you for using our service. Regarding the auction ID [REDACTED], we will contact the seller to arrange the transaction. We have confirmed from our related department that the voice packs of these items will be available on January 31, 2021. It usually takes around 2-3 business days for the code/information to be shown on your \u0026#34;My Page\u0026#34; once available. You will be notified by email after the code/information is available, and you will find it in the \u0026lt;Digital Products\u0026gt; section of your \u0026#34;My Page\u0026#34;. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns. Sincerely, [REDACTED] Buyee customer support Nice! There\u0026rsquo;s still some hope to get my digital goods! I haven\u0026rsquo;t got any email notification regarding it after one week has passed though. Probably I\u0026rsquo;ll wait until the holiday season is over before contacting the customer support again.\nOverall, both of them are kinda questionable regarding digital goods. So, if the goods are digital only, there\u0026rsquo;s no physical goods in the set, buying directly on BOOTH might be better.\nChanging delivery address Changing the delivery address is only possible before the goods are shipped(duh).\nFor Buyee, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to select a different address before shipping, simple enough.\nFor Geek Jack, I need to contact the customer service to change the delivery address. It\u0026rsquo;s simple enough though, I just need to specify the order ID and new address. Usually they also send confirmation email for the address before shipping, so I can also reply that email.\nInsurance Now this part is something I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully explored.\nThe standard plan for Buyee includes insured delivery and inspection. The insured delivery covers for damage during transit etc. While the inspection will check for mismatch between the delivered goods and the online description. That standard plan only costs 500 JPY, so I always use it6. And I never got mismatch or damaged product, so I can\u0026rsquo;t comment too much on the service itself.\nGeek Jack seems to accept exchanging damaged item: \u0026ldquo;If the item was damaged at the time of receipt, please send us email with the picture to know the damaged parts and the receiving date and time. We accept exchanging or returning within seven days of the arrival of the item.\u0026rdquo;7 But I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it before, probably the delivery cost is going to sting a bit.\nConclusion If the goods are available on Geek Jack, it might be cheaper and easier to just buy it from them. (Assuming they still use EMS.) For now I prefer using Buyee to buy it from BOOTH.\nIn the future I think I\u0026rsquo;ll try buying through Indonesian based proxy service like kyou.id.\nReferences https://web.archive.org/web/20201227111304/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/shipping-method?lang=en\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201227111350/https://www.geekjack.net/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201222115318/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/consolidate\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201222115304/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/packing\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201227121519/https://faq.buyee.jp/article/187?lang=en\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201229091738/https://buyee.jp/help/yahoo/guide/plans?lang=en\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201229092917/https://www.geekjack.net/faq.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/buyee-or-geekjack/","summary":"My personal experiences from buying VTuber goods through Buyee and Geek Jack.","title":"Buyee or Geek Jack?"},{"content":"A place where I would list some music that I really liked.

Caddy just released their v2 the other day. So I wanted to replace my old Nginx server just for the sake of it.\nBefore doing that, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better if I have something to serve from the server.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time for you to graduate from redirect slave!\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s my main reason for making this site. This site is generated with Hugo and using a nice premade theme.\nJust add a bunch of markdowns, modify the config a bit, and maybe tweak the theme fonts, and I\u0026rsquo;m done!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be this easy to make a site that looks nice(in my opinion). Deploying it should also be trivial right? Oh how I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more wrong.\nProblem Initially, I wanted to make the site compile on my machine, pack it up, and scp it to the server.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s boring. And there are other points that I care:\nWhat if I wanted to create a new post on a different machine? Do I need to setup the env on the other machine too? Maybe I want to automatically build if the site repo is updated? Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I want to make the site compile on the server.\nI quickly created a new remote repo, pushed it all up, and then pulled it from the server.\nTo build the site, all I need is just the hugo binary. The server ran on a super common linux distro, should be easy.\nThe installation docs mentioned an official debian package available. Ran sudo apt-get install hugo, and the installation finished without problem. There\u0026rsquo;s a warning about the Linux package usually is a few versions behind. Well, a few versions behind should be fine right?\nSo, I went ahead and built the site, hugo -D, easy peasy. Now just need to serve the build result.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where things start to spiral down.\nWhen I tried opening the site, it\u0026rsquo;s returning 403. Why!?\nOh, maybe I forgot to change the permission for the build result directory. Hmm, no, it\u0026rsquo;s already 755.\nSo I checked the access log. Hmm, it\u0026rsquo;s accessing the right thing, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing out of norm.\nMoving on, I checked the content of the build directory. Aha! There\u0026rsquo;s no index.html in the build result. Which is weird\u0026hellip; Why the resulting build is different here? My machine is MacOS, and I believe in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s cross platform support. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s something else?\nHmmmmm, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the hugo binary itself 🤔. Surprise! Running hugo version gives me v0.40.1. Man this is really old, I could find one or two fossils in here.\nMight as well install the binary with the same version as my machine directly. At the current time, it\u0026rsquo;s v0.71.0. Proceed to download and install the binary, yada yada yada, now I got the same version on the server.\nAfter building with same binary, the output should be the same. Wrong! It still doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate the index.html 😭.\nPretty desperate at this point. Maybe I should recheck the entire source again? Hmm, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing out of the norm. The theme? I highly doubt it, but let\u0026rsquo;s check it anyway.\nHuh? The theme directory is empty? What happened here, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I commited the entire theme to the repo.\nIs it because I used git submodule to add the theme? A quick googling tells me that this is case.\nWhen you clone a project with submodule in it, by default you get the directories that contain submodules, but none of the files within them yet.1\nOMG, all the time I spent debugging this. I probably could save them if I actually read how to use submodules first.\nSince I already cloned the repo, all I need is to fetch the missing submodules. This command did the trick:\n# This command will fetch and update all the submodules in the repo. $ git submodule update --init --recursive Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s the moment of truth.\nYatta! The index.html is here, and I can open the site 🥳🎉.\nNow my old server has been officially promoted to be a redirect servant and HTML server.\nConclusion Be careful when running any commands that you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with. While it might work now. It might cause headache or maybe even trip you in the future. Proceed carefully 😉.\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://darcien.dev/p/wheres-my-index-html/","summary":"How I learned about git submodules behavior when trying to deploy this site.","title":"Where's My index.html?"},{"content":"Hi there, my name is Yosua Ian Sebastian.
