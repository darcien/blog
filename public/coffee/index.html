One of those commercial and cheap grounded coffee. I didn’t pay that much attention to the ingredients until later on. Turns out what I’ve been drinking are not 100% coffee! It contains a bunch of things I did not expect to be in a coffee, like corn starch.\nAt some point I started buying real grounded coffee from local shop. I thought I don’t care the coffee type as long as it can be brewed into black water. After years of trying different coffee, maybe I can actually tell the difference and have some preference?\nAnd because there are so many of coffee variations, I need a way to avoid the bad ones and keep tab on my favorites.\nAnd now, here we are with a list of coffee I’ve tried and barely remember the tastes. Over the past few years, I’ve made sure to keep track of new coffee. So the tastes are from freshly brewed coffee now.\nEvery grounded coffee I’ve ever bought Country Brand/Shop Variant Taste Comment 🇦🇺 Black Vice Decaf blend (Colombia, Piedra Grande, Tolima + Pitalito, Hulia) 😌 Wouldn’t say I like the taste, but being decaf gives me reason to brew it at night! 🇦🇺 Black Vice Genesis dark roast blend (Colombia, Finca Villa Sofia + Nicaragua, La Cordillera) 🤔 Not quite the dark roast I’m expecting. Over the time it grows on me, but still not my ideal. 🇦🇺 Black Vice Hursty blend (Colombia, Andino Co-Op + Guatemala, Los Ancestros + Honduras, Edgar Urquia) 🤨 Has that slightly sweet aftertaste. Could be worse but this is not for me. 🇮🇩 Excelso Arabica Gold 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Excelso Brazilian Santos 😏 It has that unique burnt coffee taste 🇮🇩 Excelso Kalosi Toraja 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Excelso Robusta Gold 😐 -* 🇦🇺 Inglewood Bloom Seasonal Espresso blend (All Ethiopia: Hambela, Dikitu, Tulise) 😔 I realized I’m not a fan of Ethiopian coffee :( 🇦🇺 Inglewood Roosevelt blend (Brazil, Tanzania) 🙂 Okayish good, nothing remarkable 🇦🇺 Inglewood Sunset BLVD blend (Papua New Guinea, Peru, Chinese catimore) 😐 Meh, too bland for my taste 🇮🇩 Kopi Boutique Arabica Toraja Sulotco Sulawesi 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Kopi Boutique Robusta Java Dampit 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Macehat Arabica Sumatra Mandheling 🤔 Not a good latte material for me 🇮🇩 Northsider Aceh Gayo Wine 🤢 Well it kinda look like wine, but the taste, ugh I can’t bear it, sorry 🇮🇩 Northsider Arabica Flores Bajawa Fully-washed 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider Arabica Gunung Halu Banana Honey 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider Arabica Ijen Blue Mountain Honey 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider Arabica Java Malabar Red Honey 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider Arabica Toraja Bittuang Natural 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider Black Onyx blend (Robusta Java, Arabica West Java \u0026 Aceh) 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider Classic blend (Robusta Dampit, Arabica Flores) 😀 Starting tad bland, but feels strong later on, not bad! 🇮🇩 Northsider Cold White blend (Robusta Temanggung, Arabica West Java \u0026 Gayo) 😐 -* 🇮🇩 Northsider North blend (All Arabica: Columbia, Brazil, Ethiopia) 😐 Feels weird at first, but it tastes just okay after a while. 🇮🇩 Northsider Razeta'55 blend (Arabica Brazil, Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) ❤️ I’ve been buying this blend for more than a year straight, probably my favorite blend so far. 🇮🇩 Northsider Sweet Gayo blend (Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) 😊 Just like the name suggests, it smells sweet. With milk, not so much, but I still like it. 🇮🇩 Sido Mulia Sido Mulia Premium (Robusta Dampit is my assumption) 😐 Meh, tastes like your usual bitter bland coffee. Not worth the premium price from this brand. 🇦🇺 St. ALi Orthodox blend (60% Colombia, 40% Brazil, Caturra + Colombia + Castillo + Red Bourbon) 🙂 Taste like the “coffee”. Not too strong, not too bland, aptly named orthodox. 🇦🇺 St. ALi Wide Awake blend (60% Alta Mogiana, 40% Santa Ana) 👍 Good, real dark roast, but still can’t beat dark field, something is missing. 🇦🇺 Stitch Coffee Dark Field blend ❤️ So far this is the best dark roast. Dark choco taste so good. *) I can barely remember the taste for some of the coffee in the list, some are too acidic, some has that floral smell, but I lost those notes. So some of the taste and comments is kinda outdated until I bought them again for curiosity.\nYour coffee taste description sucks! I know. I’m making this list to remind myself how a certain blend tastes like. And it’s totally different story when trying to describe how coffee tastes to someone else. I still need to work on that and have more descriptive report instead of just good vs not good.\nAt some point, I shared the list with friends, and they said I should’ve put the tasting notes or profiles, not just the beans and blend. Oops, maybe for another future revision.\nIs latte an upgrade to coffee with milk? My friend from the office offered me an old espresso machine he wants to get rid of. He said it leaks on high pressure, otherwise it’s still perfectly functional. Well, why not? I accepted.\nYeah, just like what he said, the first few attempts fail spectacularly. I suck at grinding the beans and adjusting the coffee amount. I had to do 3 tries just to get coffee flowing out of the portafilter.\nMy first ever (successful?) espresso along with the Sunbeam espresso machine and grinder. Taken at 2025-10-10.\nNow that I know the grind size needed and got better at eyeballing the coffee amount, no more failed attempts!\nHow did you make the coffee? (after October 2025) The espresso machine is now my primary coffee source. To be specific, it’s a Sunbeam Cafe Series EM6910 (probably at least 10 y.o.).\nSince it’s an espresso machine, I have to start from beans. (Otherwise all the coffee nerds around me will yell at me for not using fresh beans)\nGrind the beans to espresso size. Fill and stamp the portafilter until it’s around ~3mm from the top of the container. (I’m just following the machine manual, not sure if this is the “correct” way.)\nHit the 2 shots button while watching the pressure gauge. Always the 2 shots because that’s the only filter size I have inherited.\nPour 200 mL of milk and steam it using the steam wand. Stop around 60ºC-ish.\nPour the milk to the coffee, making 2 cups of lattes, done!\nThe latte art looks pretty good considering I suck at it. Taken at 2025-11-15.\nHow did you make the coffee? (before October 2025) It’s almost always pour over grounded coffee using paper filter. I’ve been using the same Hario V60 dripper for years.\nGood old manual coffee dripper.\nFor the coffee, I use around 16g coffee for 3 servings. Then grab whatever milk from the fridge, usually it’s plain but it could be some low-fat mochachino. Pour the milk to the mug first. Then pour the coffee, done!\nA warm coffee with milk, calms my mind 👌\n(Maybe one day I’ll upgrade my kit and include practicing making latte art 🤔)\nHow “fresh” is the roasted beans? I’ve read/heard from people that using fresher roasted beans gives better coffee tastes. Honestly, I can’t tell the differences. As long as the coffee powder is still good, no mold etc., I have no complaints.\nFor example, these coffee from Northsider, I bought them at 24 October. And from the packaging, it says production date is 17 October. Assuming it’s the roasting date, hey it only took 7 days from coffee beans to ready to use coffee powder. Fresh and enough for me. Heck, it’s way fresher than the coffee being enjoyed by these cool people in Antarctica. One of their coffee is 3 years old!\nBack side of some Northsider’s coffee bags, it says production date: 2023-10-17, and best before: 2024-10. Taken at 2023-10-26.\nOther Photos? My first 1 kg coffee beans. I’ve never hold this much coffee in one hand before. Taken at 2025-12-06.\nSame journey, different brand. Second candidate, Black Vice, taken at 2025-07-20.\nStarting a hunt to find the best dark roast in Melbourne for revenge gift. First candidate, St. ALi, taken at 2025-06-16.\nI just moved to a new place and don’t have a functional table yet. Hence the coffee is on unfinished table, I don’t have screwdriver at that time. The ultimate dark roast was gift from a friend, thanks Em! Taken at 2025-04-08.\nTrying some brand mentioned by friend, it’s pricey and not that good 😂, taken at 2024-12-08.\nGot some freshly roasted beans from Sumatra, taken at 2023-11-19.\nBack side showing it was roasted 11 days prior to the photo. My sister literally told me to drink it before 14 days pass from roasted date. Taken at 2023-11-19.\nFinally trying out new blend after drinking the same blend for a year, taken at 2023-10-26.\nNorthsider’s Ijen Blue Mountain packaging, taken at 2020-07-14.\nNorthsider’s Toraja Bittuang packaging, a bit different than the usual since this one use cylindrical carton. Taken at 2020-07-14.\nThe packaging for Dampit coffee from Kopi Boutique, taken at 2020-05-31.\nI mistakenly bought roasted coffee beans. Having no coffee grinders, I had to resort to drastic measures. Taken at 2019-03-30.\nChangelog 2025-12-06: add Sunbeam espresso machine 2025-07-20: add Black Vice brand 2025-07-05: add Stitch, St. ALi and country flags to table 2025-05-24: add Inglewood brand 2024-12-08: add Sido Mulia brand 2024-06-16: add sweet gayo blend 2023-12-03: add macehat and classic blend 2023-10-28: add various pics 2023-10-12: initial version ","wordCount":"1623","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-10-12T14:38:06Z","dateModified":"2023-10-12T14:38:06Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yosua"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://darcien.dev/coffee/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A blog by Yosua Ian Sebastian","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://darcien.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://darcien.dev/ accesskey=h title="Yosua Ian Sebastian (Alt + H)"><img src=https://darcien.dev/whale_goth.svg alt aria-label=logo height=28>Yosua Ian Sebastian</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
