It contains a bunch of things I did not expect to be in a coffee, like corn starch.\nAt some point I started buying real grounded coffee from local shop. I thought I don’t care the coffee type as long as it can be brewed into black water. After years of trying different coffee, maybe I can actually tell the difference and have some preference?\nAnd because there are so many of coffee variations, I need a way to avoid the bad ones and keep tab on my favorites.\nAnd now, here we are with a list of coffee I’ve tried and barely remember the tastes.\nEvery grounded coffee I’ve ever bought (or barely remember) Brand/Shop Variant Taste Comment Excelso Arabica Gold 😐 - Excelso Brazilian Santos 😏 It has that unique burnt coffee taste Excelso Kalosi Toraja 😐 - Excelso Robusta Gold 😐 - Kopi Boutique Arabica Toraja Sulotco Sulawesi 😐 - Kopi Boutique Robusta Java Dampit 😐 - Macehat Arabica Sumatra Mandheling 🤔 Not a good latte material for me Northsider Aceh Gayo Wine 🤢 Well it kinda look like wine, but the taste, ugh I can’t bear it, sorry Northsider Arabica Flores Bajawa Fully-washed 😐 - Northsider Arabica Gunung Halu Banana Honey 😐 - Northsider Arabica Ijen Blue Mountain Honey 😐 - Northsider Arabica Java Malabar Red Honey 😐 - Northsider Arabica Toraja Bittuang Natural 😐 - Northsider Black Onyx blend (Robusta Java, Arabica West Java \u0026 Aceh) 😐 - Northsider Classic blend (Robusta Dampit, Arabica Flores) 😀 Starting tad bland, but feels strong later on, not bad! Northsider Cold White blend (Robusta Temanggung, Arabica West Java \u0026 Gayo) 😐 - Northsider North blend (All Arabica: Columbia, Brazil, Ethiopia) 😐 Feels weird at first, but it tastes just okay after a while. Northsider Razeta'55 blend (Arabica Brazil, Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) ❤️ I’ve been buying this blend for more than a year straight, probably my favorite blend so far. Northsider Sweet Gayo blend (Arabica Gayo, Robusta Temanggung) 😊 Just like the name suggests, it smells sweet. With milk, not so much, but I still like it. Sido Mulia Sido Mulia Premium (Robusta Dampit is my assumption) 😐 Meh, tastes like your usual bitter bland coffee. Not worth the premium price from this brand. I can barely remember the taste for some of the coffee in the list, some are too acidic, some has that floral smell, but I lost those notes. So some of the taste and comments is kinda outdated until I bought them again for curiosity.\nHow did you make the coffee? It’s almost always pour over grounded coffee using paper filter. I’ve been using the same Hario V60 dripper for years.\nGood old manual coffee dripper.\nFor the coffee, I use around 16g coffee for 3 servings. Then grab whatever milk from the fridge, usually it’s plain but it could be some low-fat mochachino. Pour the milk to the mug first. Then pour the coffee, done!\nA warm coffee with milk, calms my mind 👌\n(Maybe one day I’ll upgrade my kit and include practicing making latte art 🤔)\nHow “fresh” is the roasted beans? I’ve read/heard from people that using fresher roasted beans gives better coffee tastes. Honestly, I can’t tell the differences. As long as the coffee powder is still good, no mold etc., I have no complaints.\nFor example, these coffee from Northsider, I bought them at 24 October. And from the packaging, it says production date is 17 October. Assuming it’s the roasting date, hey it only took 7 days from coffee beans to ready to use coffee powder. Fresh and enough for me. Heck, it’s way fresher than the coffee being enjoyed by these cool people in Antarctica. One of their coffee is 3 years old!\nBack side of some Northsider’s coffee bags, it says production date: 2023-10-17, and best before: 2024-10. Taken at 2023-10-26.\nOther Photos? Trying some brand mentioned by friend, it’s pricey and not that good 😂, taken at 2024-12-08.\nGot some freshly roasted beans from Sumatra, taken at 2023-11-19.\nBack side showing it was roasted 11 days prior to the photo. My sister literally told me to drink it before 14 days pass from roasted date. Taken at 2023-11-19.\nFinally trying out new blend after drinking the same blend for a year, taken at 2023-10-26.\nNorthsider’s Ijen Blue Mountain packaging, taken at 2020-07-14.\nNorthsider’s Toraja Bittuang packaging, a bit different than the usual since this one use cylindrical carton. Taken at 2020-07-14.\nThe packaging for Dampit coffee from Kopi Boutique, taken at 2020-05-31.\nI mistakenly bought roasted coffee beans. Having no coffee grinders, I had to resort to drastic measures. Taken at 2019-03-30.\nChangelog 2024-12-08: add Sido Mulia brand 2024-06-16: add sweet gayo blend 2023-12-03: add macehat and classic blend 2023-10-28: add various pics 2023-10-12: initial version ","wordCount":"877","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-10-12T14:38:06Z","dateModified":"2023-10-12T14:38:06Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yosua"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://darcien.dev/coffee/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A blog by Yosua Ian Sebastian","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://darcien.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://darcien.dev/ accesskey=h title="Yosua Ian Sebastian (Alt + H)"><img src=https://darcien.dev/whale_goth.svg alt aria-label=logo height=28>Yosua Ian Sebastian</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
