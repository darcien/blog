Internet connection is already close being a public utility. And here I am, having a hard time trying to find decent ISP that can provides service to my place.\nI’ve been trying to change providers since at least 4 months ago. And this effort will probably continue to 2023.\nProvider Checklist I’m looking at these things while looking for ISP:\nAvailable at my place (duh) Sane pricing, I’m not going to pay for enterprise pricing No scummy practice (ok, maybe at least minimal, none at all is unlikely to exists) Use fiber connection or better No weird quota or policy on rate limiting Good uptime (it’s 2022, please don’t timeout when it’s raining) And these are nice to have but not required:\nInternet only (no, I do not want to subscribe to your whatever TV/CCTV/streaming services) Bring-my-own-modem or at least don’t charge me with overpriced modem rent per month to the point I can buy the modem 4 times a year IPv6 support (is this even a thing in Indonesia?) Here I go, checking every single ISP that provides fiber connection and operates in Indonesia. Like every single one of them, from “every person know this name” to “is that an actual service name?”.\nIs it available in my place? ISP available BaliFiber ❌ Biznet Home ❌ CBN Fiber ❌ First Media ✅ Groovy ❌ Iconnet (PLN) ✅ IndiHome (Telkom) ✅ indonet ❔* Indosat HiFi (Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison) ❌ Megavision ❌ MNC Play ❔** MyRepublic ❌ Oxygen.id ✅ Transvision Hi-Speed ❌ XL Home ❌ XL Satu Fiber ❌ *: indonet seems to only offer enterprise plan, I’m not going to contact their sales for checking that.\n**: MNC Play requires me to fill a form with personal identification etc. to check for coverage area.

I’m convinced I don’t need to live in this city. There’s not much point in finding the ultimate ISP if every other aspects in life also sucks here for me. Might as well try to move to a better place.\n2023-01-09 - Iconnet First time I heard about “Iconnet” from my coworkers. Apparently it’s backed by Indo’s PLN. I checked their site, apparently my place is covered. But, it’s not great according to my source 🫠.\nWhat makes this ISP even funnier is that their own landing page have an empty testimony section.\n2022-12-31 - First Media I already used First Media from the time they start showing up in my area (probably around ~2013). At that time, they provide real fast connection. But over the time, their price keeps climbing while the stability spirals downhill. People I know have been saying this is because they keep adding more customers to existing terminals regardless of the terminal capacity instead of adding more terminals 😕.\nFast forward 10 years later, after asking around, they still have the same issues. Ignoring the ridiculous amount of spam from their marketing, I hate the fact that their prices varies based on how much pressure you put into their customer support or sales. The more you complaint and want to cut their connection, the more discount you get 🤨. Not being transparent with the pricing model is a bad enough sign for me to stay away.\n2022-11-27 - Oxygen.id A promising ISP, if I could actually use it.\n2022-10-01, late night: I applied via their online registration.\nSame day, 9 p.m.: Contacted by their sales via WhatsApp, asking for location coordinates etc.\n2022-10-03: Registration and payment completed, waiting for their technician now.\n2022-10-04: Their technician came while it’s raining heavily. Technician said all nearby terminals are full. Need to request validation team and see whether they can free up some unused terminal slots.\n2022-10-10: Call from their sales, validation in progress.\n2022-10-18: Another call from their sales, validation still in progress and might take even more time. They’re asking to refund my money for now.\n2022-11-27: I asked the same sales for updates on the validation. No reply.\nLater on their sales did “react” to my messages though: Truly a 😂 moment.\nNow, I have no idea whether that person just quit from being a sales or it’s their official response. There’s still some hope from this ISP if I tried to contact them again. But not now, right now I don’t have the patience to sit out months just for them to check whether they have available slots for me or not.\nBonus: I can’t login to my customer account after changing the default password to a 25-characters password. Pressing login does nothing, no message or UI feedback whatsoever. I suspect my password is over the length limit they have for password 🙃.\nPost 12 of #100DaysToOffload.\n","wordCount":"821","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-30T22:33:38+07:00","dateModified":"2022-12-30T22:33:38+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yosua"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://darcien.dev/p/fiber-internet-jakarta-and-2022/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A blog by Yosua Ian Sebastian","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://darcien.dev/whale72.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://darcien.dev/ accesskey=h title="Yosua Ian Sebastian (Alt + H)"><img src=https://darcien.dev/whale72.png alt aria-label=logo height=28>Yosua Ian Sebastian</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://darcien.dev/about title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darcien.dev/uses title=uses><span>uses</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darcien.dev/tags title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://darcien.dev/search title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Fiber Internet, Jakarta, and 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-30 22:33:38 +0700 WIB'>2022-12-30</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;821 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Yosua</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Today is the last day of 2022.
