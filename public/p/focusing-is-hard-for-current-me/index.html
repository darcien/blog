Super interesting for me as I like the stacked PR approach. Maybe if I use it here, it will give me some good productivity and mood boost! 1 hour trying, and… nope. I will stick with plain old git. It is compatible with git, but you can’t use existing local git repo and start using sl (Sapling binary, equivalent to git) right away. You need to clone the remote again using sl clone as it use .sl instead of .git. The fact that sl errors with abort: '' is not inside a repository, but this command requires a repository! does not help all. (Google only return 1 hit for that error and it’s the source repo :), thankfully someone posted an issue upstream and has provided solution there, so thanks for that.)\nIt’s not only that, I also had a bunch of problem with sub modules and default-push behavior not working correctly. The web manual and help output from the binary also doesn’t match. Undocumented commands here and there. Sapling is cool, probably it works great in Meta, but for me and my solo micro sized project, nah.\nAfter that, I also had to deal with a bunch of Windows env things. I’m pretty sure I already have hugo binary installed and ready to use. Why would I get unknown command when running it? Maybe I fucked up some time ago, maybe a Windows update, maybe a rogue install script, who knows? Here we go, spelunking into Windows system env just to run a binary without specifying the full path every single time.\nOkay, Windows env all fixed up, good path, binary is in the path, all good.

(Later on I realized restarting just VSCode also works)\nNow we have everything, I would start writing right? Turns out no, I just had to try and clean things up.
